How's it going, guys? So, in this How's it going, guys? So, in this How's it going, guys? So, in this tutorial, we're going to be making this tutorial, we're going to be making this tutorial, we're going to be making this render right here. First thing we're render right here. First thing we're render right here. First thing we're going to do is hop into geometry nodes going to do is hop into geometry nodes going to do is hop into geometry nodes and model the larger objects. Then, and model the larger objects. Then, and model the larger objects. Then, we're going to use the same procedure we're going to use the same procedure we're going to use the same procedure and make the smaller objects. And for and make the smaller objects. And for and make the smaller objects. And for the first time on this channel, I'm the first time on this channel, I'm the first time on this channel, I'm going to show you guys how to create going to show you guys how to create going to show you guys how to create booleans directly within geometry nodes booleans directly within geometry nodes booleans directly within geometry nodes to clean up that whole system. This to clean up that whole system. This to clean up that whole system. This animation was inspired by Tron. So, animation was inspired by Tron. So, animation was inspired by Tron. So, we're going to be doing a little bit of we're going to be doing a little bit of we're going to be doing a little bit of wireframing to get that Tron inspired wireframing to get that Tron inspired wireframing to get that Tron inspired look. Then after that, we're going to look. Then after that, we're going to look. Then after that, we're going to hop into the shader editor and work on hop into the shader editor and work on hop into the shader editor and work on detailing the metallic material on all detailing the metallic material on all detailing the metallic material on all of those objects. Then my favorite part, of those objects. Then my favorite part, of those objects. Then my favorite part, we're going to make a procedural we're going to make a procedural we're going to make a procedural material on the floor to create that material on the floor to create that material on the floor to create that really, really cool pattern. Then we're really, really cool pattern. Then we're really, really cool pattern. Then we're going to bring it all together and going to bring it all together and going to bring it all together and render out a really cool looking sci-fi render out a really cool looking sci-fi render out a really cool looking sci-fi image. This tutorial is part of a larger image. This tutorial is part of a larger image. This tutorial is part of a larger group of tutorials that I just put on group of tutorials that I just put on group of tutorials that I just put on Patreon that's going to show you all the Patreon that's going to show you all the Patreon that's going to show you all the different ways you can combine patterns different ways you can combine patterns different ways you can combine patterns and processes and shapes and modeling to and processes and shapes and modeling to and processes and shapes and modeling to create really, really cool looking create really, really cool looking create really, really cool looking sci-fi scenes. It's six tutorials and sci-fi scenes. It's six tutorials and sci-fi scenes. It's six tutorials and again available right now. If you want again available right now.

With discount if you subscribe annually. With discount if you subscribe annually. With that being said, let's hop into this that being said, let's hop into this that being said, let's hop into this tutorial. All right, first we're going tutorial. All right, first we're going tutorial. All right, first we're going to get the modeling portion out of the to get the modeling portion out of the to get the modeling portion out of the way. So, what I'm going to do is just way. So, what I'm going to do is just way. So, what I'm going to do is just hit shift A. We're going to get a plane hit shift A. We're going to get a plane hit shift A. We're going to get a plane and I'm going to bring over just a brand and I'm going to bring over just a brand and I'm going to bring over just a brand new window and make that my geometry new window and make that my geometry new window and make that my geometry nodes editor. We're going to click new nodes editor. We're going to click new nodes editor. We're going to click new and as always, we're going to delete the and as always, we're going to delete the and as always, we're going to delete the input and we're going to start out with input and we're going to start out with input and we're going to start out with a a a grid grid grid right here. It's over here. Let's make right here. It's over here. Let's make right here. It's over here. Let's make it 10 by 10. And let's go ahead and it 10 by 10. And let's go ahead and it 10 by 10. And let's go ahead and distribute. We're going to hit shift a distribute. We're going to hit shift a distribute. We're going to hit shift a search distribute points on faces just search distribute points on faces just search distribute points on faces just like this. And we're right now we're like this. And we're right now we're like this. And we're right now we're going to model the big shapes. So we're going to model the big shapes. So we're going to model the big shapes. So we're going to get the density at point 2 for going to get the density at point 2 for going to get the density at point 2 for now. And we'll see uh how we feel later. now. And we'll see uh how we feel later. now. And we'll see uh how we feel later. And let's get a instance on points node. And let's get a instance on points node. And let's get a instance on points node. And of course we need to instance some And of course we need to instance some And of course we need to instance some cubes. So let's plug him right into cubes. So let's plug him right into cubes. So let's plug him right into instance. And now we have uh a random instance. And now we have uh a random instance. And now we have uh a random distribution. Now to make this really distribution. Now to make this really distribution. Now to make this really cool sci-fi, we need to go ahead and get cool sci-fi, we need to go ahead and get cool sci-fi, we need to go ahead and get in a random value set to vector. The in a random value set to vector. The in a random value set to vector. The reason why I want to do vector is reason why I want to do vector is reason why I want to do vector is because we want to randomize X, Y, and Z because we want to randomize X, Y, and Z because we want to randomize X, Y, and Z of all of these cubes, not just a of all of these cubes, not just a of all of these cubes, not just a minimum and a maximum. So that would minimum and a maximum. So that would minimum and a maximum. So that would keep essentially them what would be the keep essentially them what would be the keep essentially them what would be the term uniform. In this case, if we do term uniform. In this case, if we do term uniform. In this case, if we do vector, it's actually going to randomize vector, it's actually going to randomize vector, it's actually going to randomize all options X, Y, and Z, which is really all options X, Y, and Z, which is really all options X, Y, and Z, which is really cool. And what we're looking for. So on cool. And what we're looking for. So on cool. And what we're looking for. So on these, we're just going to give them a these, we're just going to give them a these, we're just going to give them a scale of two. And then here, my exact scale of two. And then here, my exact scale of two. And then here, my exact settings were 4.4 two. two. two. And then make them really short. And then make them really short. And then make them really short. Something like this. And then maybe Something like this. And then maybe Something like this. And then maybe bring him down as well. We want them to bring him down as well. We want them to bring him down as well. We want them to be pretty short. We can edit how tall be pretty short. We can edit how tall be pretty short. We can edit how tall they are a bit later, but right now they are a bit later, but right now they are a bit later, but right now we're just focusing on large objects we're just focusing on large objects we're just focusing on large objects here, the big pieces of the scene. So here, the big pieces of the scene. So here, the big pieces of the scene. So now we have this and then there is a now we have this and then there is a now we have this and then there is a seed value if you want something else. seed value if you want something else. seed value if you want something else. And actually I think I saw something I And actually I think I saw something I And actually I think I saw something I like like like h I don't know h I don't know h I don't know maybe bring the density down. maybe bring the density down. maybe bring the density down. Yeah, this is good. Okay, so I think we Yeah, this is good. Okay, so I think we Yeah, this is good. Okay, so I think we can work with this really really well. can work with this really really well. can work with this really really well. Now what I want to do is distribute our Now what I want to do is distribute our Now what I want to do is distribute our smaller pieces throughout the scene as smaller pieces throughout the scene as smaller pieces throughout the scene as well. Actually this this is good. So now well. Actually this this is good. So now well. Actually this this is good. So now what I want to do is get the small what I want to do is get the small what I want to do is get the small details distributed next. So what we're details distributed next. So what we're details distributed next. So what we're going to do is get a join geometry. going to do is get a join geometry. going to do is get a join geometry. Same grid. We're going to get a Same grid. We're going to get a Same grid. We're going to get a distribute points on faces and we'll distribute points on faces and we'll distribute points on faces and we'll just plug that right into here. Now we just plug that right into here. Now we just plug that right into here. Now we have a bunch of new points that we can have a bunch of new points that we can have a bunch of new points that we can put another instance on points. put another instance on points. put another instance on points. We'll just use the same cube. No need in We'll just use the same cube. No need in We'll just use the same cube. No need in getting a brand new one. getting a brand new one. getting a brand new one. Let's bring that density down to Let's bring that density down to Let's bring that density down to something like something like something like two. And we'll get another random value. Set that to vector. And we'll go right Set that to vector. And we'll go right Set that to vector. And we'll go right here into the scale. So right now here into the scale. So right now here into the scale. So right now I'm just going to give them both a value I'm just going to give them both a value I'm just going to give them both a value of one and just scale them down till I of one and just scale them down till I of one and just scale them down till I like their kind of general size. And like their kind of general size. And like their kind of general size. And then then then we can make them small. we can make them small. we can make them small. Stretch them out. Stretch them out. Stretch them out. Something like that. Okay. So, these are Something like that. Okay. So, these are Something like that. Okay. So, these are my exact settings for these small ones. my exact settings for these small ones. my exact settings for these small ones. This is my exact settings for the large This is my exact settings for the large This is my exact settings for the large ones. If we look at the wireframe now, ones. If we look at the wireframe now, ones. If we look at the wireframe now, you'll notice everything is you'll notice everything is you'll notice everything is intersecting. You can see there's a lot intersecting. You can see there's a lot intersecting. You can see there's a lot of objects within the big objects. And of objects within the big objects. And of objects within the big objects. And when it comes to wireframing them, it when it comes to wireframing them, it when it comes to wireframing them, it will definitely highlight the fact that will definitely highlight the fact that will definitely highlight the fact that objects are going inside of other objects are going inside of other objects are going inside of other objects. That might not be preferable to objects. That might not be preferable to objects. That might not be preferable to you. It's definitely not pref It's you. It's definitely not pref It's you. It's definitely not pref It's definitely not preferable to me. So, definitely not preferable to me. So, definitely not preferable to me. So, what we need to do is get a mesh boolean what we need to do is get a mesh boolean what we need to do is get a mesh boolean right here. And I'm going to switch it right here. And I'm going to switch it right here. And I'm going to switch it to union. Let me go back to wireframe. to union. Let me go back to wireframe. to union. Let me go back to wireframe. And we can watch what happens, And we can watch what happens, And we can watch what happens, especially in these bigger chunks. If we especially in these bigger chunks. If we especially in these bigger chunks. If we just put it right here and there we go. just put it right here and there we go. just put it right here and there we go. We now have mesh booleans going We now have mesh booleans going We now have mesh booleans going everywhere in the scene. and it looks everywhere in the scene. and it looks everywhere in the scene. and it looks really really cool. So then what's going really really cool. So then what's going really really cool. So then what's going to happen is when we go to the to happen is when we go to the to happen is when we go to the wireframe, the wireframe is actually wireframe, the wireframe is actually wireframe, the wireframe is actually going to highlight that these objects going to highlight that these objects going to highlight that these objects stop here rather than you can see stop here rather than you can see stop here rather than you can see wireframes going inside of the object. wireframes going inside of the object. wireframes going inside of the object. And it's really just not very And it's really just not very And it's really just not very good-looking. If you want to be able to good-looking. If you want to be able to good-looking. If you want to be able to view this better, you can hit this drop view this better, you can hit this drop view this better, you can hit this drop down right here and do a cavity shadow down right here and do a cavity shadow down right here and do a cavity shadow and outline. And that's going to make uh and outline. And that's going to make uh and outline. And that's going to make uh looking at this a little bit e a little looking at this a little bit e a little looking at this a little bit e a little bit easier. Next thing we could do is bit easier. Next thing we could do is bit easier. Next thing we could do is add wireframes to this whole system on add wireframes to this whole system on add wireframes to this whole system on this distribute points where it says this distribute points where it says this distribute points where it says 4.29. 4.29. 4.29. I'm going to get a value node and just I'm going to get a value node and just I'm going to get a value node and just paste that in there so I can remember paste that in there so I can remember paste that in there so I can remember it. I'm just going to bring this down to it. I'm just going to bring this down to it. I'm just going to bring this down to like 0.5 just to lighten up my scene like 0.5 just to lighten up my scene like 0.5 just to lighten up my scene because it is really really heavy. And I because it is really really heavy. And I because it is really really heavy. And I want to add some wireframe. I want to want to add some wireframe. I want to want to add some wireframe. I want to add materials. And every movement we add materials. And every movement we add materials. And every movement we make is going to kind of bog down. So make is going to kind of bog down. So make is going to kind of bog down. So I'm just going to keep this as a I'm just going to keep this as a I'm just going to keep this as a reminder. Set this lower and we can move reminder. Set this lower and we can move reminder. Set this lower and we can move on. So, what I want to do after the mesh on. So, what I want to do after the mesh on. So, what I want to do after the mesh boolean is get a boolean is get a boolean is get a mesh to curve mesh to curve mesh to curve and a and a and a curve to mesh node and get a curve curve to mesh node and get a curve curve to mesh node and get a curve circle circle circle there. We're going to give it a there. We're going to give it a there. We're going to give it a resolution of six because we aren't resolution of six because we aren't resolution of six because we aren't really going to see that many. It really going to see that many. It really going to see that many. It doesn't need to be high poly. And then doesn't need to be high poly. And then doesn't need to be high poly. And then I'm going to do 01. I'm going to do 01. I'm going to do 01. Plug that into the profile. And we now Plug that into the profile. And we now Plug that into the profile. And we now have a wireframe of everything. What I have a wireframe of everything. What I have a wireframe of everything. What I want to get is a join geometry. And want to get is a join geometry. And want to get is a join geometry. And right at the mesh boolean, just bring right at the mesh boolean, just bring right at the mesh boolean, just bring everything back. We now have uh everything back. We now have uh everything back. We now have uh wireframes on everything. And let's go wireframes on everything. And let's go wireframes on everything. And let's go ahead and click on fill caps and bring ahead and click on fill caps and bring ahead and click on fill caps and bring the radius to like 06, maybe 0.6, just a the radius to like 06, maybe 0.6, just a the radius to like 06, maybe 0.6, just a smaller wireframe. And we're ready to smaller wireframe. And we're ready to smaller wireframe. And we're ready to move on. Last thing I want to do here in move on. Last thing I want to do here in move on. Last thing I want to do here in this grid, just plug that into our join this grid, just plug that into our join this grid, just plug that into our join geometry. And now we have that floor geometry. And now we have that floor geometry. And now we have that floor portion that we're going to add some portion that we're going to add some portion that we're going to add some really cool materials to as well. And really cool materials to as well. And really cool materials to as well. And we're done with the modeling portion of we're done with the modeling portion of we're done with the modeling portion of this tutorial. We can go ahead and set this tutorial. We can go ahead and set this tutorial. We can go ahead and set up materials. So I'm going to get a set up materials. So I'm going to get a set up materials. So I'm going to get a set material node and put one on each of material node and put one on each of material node and put one on each of these final lines. This one these final lines. This one these final lines. This one corresponding with the flat portion. So corresponding with the flat portion. So corresponding with the flat portion. So let's go to the material portion, let's go to the material portion, let's go to the material portion, material side. Let's get new and call it material side. Let's get new and call it material side. Let's get new and call it flat. Let's add that there. We're going flat. Let's add that there. We're going flat. Let's add that there. We're going to get another one. Call it to get another one. Call it to get another one. Call it wire. And then you can see where it says wire. And then you can see where it says wire. And then you can see where it says curve to mesh, mesh to curve. Just add curve to mesh, mesh to curve. Just add curve to mesh, mesh to curve. Just add the wire material. And then we can just the wire material. And then we can just the wire material. And then we can just call this one call this one call this one cubes. They're all going to have the cubes. They're all going to have the cubes. They're all going to have the same material. So we'll add that there. same material. So we'll add that there. same material. So we'll add that there. So now we are ready to move on over to So now we are ready to move on over to So now we are ready to move on over to the shading. So I'm going to switch this the shading. So I'm going to switch this the shading. So I'm going to switch this window to the shader editor. And note up window to the shader editor. And note up window to the shader editor. And note up here where you can grab your materials. here where you can grab your materials. here where you can grab your materials. So I'm going to go to cycles. You can So I'm going to go to cycles. You can So I'm going to go to cycles. You can also render this in EV if you're more also render this in EV if you're more also render this in EV if you're more comfortable in that engine. Um we're comfortable in that engine. Um we're comfortable in that engine. Um we're going to be using cycles for all of going to be using cycles for all of going to be using cycles for all of these materials. So, what I'm going to these materials. So, what I'm going to these materials. So, what I'm going to do here is grab the flat material first. do here is grab the flat material first. do here is grab the flat material first. I'm going to give it a black color. On I'm going to give it a black color. On I'm going to give it a black color. On emission, I'm going to give it a red and emission, I'm going to give it a red and emission, I'm going to give it a red and give it a strength of like three and give it a strength of like three and give it a strength of like three and make the roughness really, really low. make the roughness really, really low. make the roughness really, really low. So, now we get this shiny emissive So, now we get this shiny emissive So, now we get this shiny emissive floor, which is really going to make floor, which is really going to make floor, which is really going to make this just look really awesome. Next this just look really awesome. Next this just look really awesome. Next thing I want to do is when go over to thing I want to do is when go over to thing I want to do is when go over to the wire, I'm actually going to go hover the wire, I'm actually going to go hover the wire, I'm actually going to go hover over here and hit C. I'm going to grab over here and hit C. I'm going to grab over here and hit C. I'm going to grab the wire and do the same exact thing. the wire and do the same exact thing. the wire and do the same exact thing. Roughness, low, emission. I'm going to Roughness, low, emission. I'm going to Roughness, low, emission. I'm going to paste that there and give it a strength paste that there and give it a strength paste that there and give it a strength of three. So, now we have these emissive of three. So, now we have these emissive of three. So, now we have these emissive wireframes. Now, for the fun part, one wireframes. Now, for the fun part, one wireframes. Now, for the fun part, one of the fun parts really, is getting of the fun parts really, is getting of the fun parts really, is getting these cubes to look really cool. So, these cubes to look really cool. So, these cubes to look really cool. So, let's bring the metallic up. We'll bring let's bring the metallic up. We'll bring let's bring the metallic up. We'll bring the color somewhere over here. And we're the color somewhere over here. And we're the color somewhere over here. And we're going to play with roughness first. So, going to play with roughness first. So, going to play with roughness first. So, we're going to get a mix color cuz we're we're going to get a mix color cuz we're we're going to get a mix color cuz we're going to combine two materials. This is going to combine two materials. This is going to combine two materials. This is one of my favorite ways to make an one of my favorite ways to make an one of my favorite ways to make an interesting sci-fi material. So, let's interesting sci-fi material. So, let's interesting sci-fi material. So, let's go ahead and get in a go ahead and get in a go ahead and get in a noise texture. If you have the node noise texture. If you have the node noise texture. If you have the node wrangler add-on enabled, I'm going to wrangler add-on enabled, I'm going to wrangler add-on enabled, I'm going to hit CtrlT, get the object coordinate, hit CtrlT, get the object coordinate, hit CtrlT, get the object coordinate, and plug factor into A. And I just want and plug factor into A. And I just want and plug factor into A. And I just want to look at A. So, that's going to be to to look at A. So, that's going to be to to look at A. So, that's going to be to the left. And we also need a color ramp. the left. And we also need a color ramp. the left. And we also need a color ramp. So, let's bring this in. Bring that in. So, let's bring this in. Bring that in. So, let's bring this in. Bring that in. We're starting to get something really We're starting to get something really We're starting to get something really cool. I'm going to bring my detail to 12 cool. I'm going to bring my detail to 12 cool. I'm going to bring my detail to 12 and my roughness really high and then and my roughness really high and then and my roughness really high and then just bring this down a bit. So, right just bring this down a bit. So, right just bring this down a bit. So, right about now, I think is when I'm going to about now, I think is when I'm going to about now, I think is when I'm going to pick my composition and my lighting cuz pick my composition and my lighting cuz pick my composition and my lighting cuz the lighting is going to greatly affect the lighting is going to greatly affect the lighting is going to greatly affect the decisions that I'm going to make the decisions that I'm going to make the decisions that I'm going to make with the shading, especially with with the shading, especially with with the shading, especially with roughness and reflection. So, I want to roughness and reflection. So, I want to roughness and reflection. So, I want to set up my lighting now. So, that means I set up my lighting now. So, that means I set up my lighting now. So, that means I also want to set up my camera view. also want to set up my camera view. also want to set up my camera view. So maybe something like that. That's a pretty cool angle. Yeah. All That's a pretty cool angle. Yeah. All That's a pretty cool angle. Yeah. All right. right. right. Creates this big red channel so we can Creates this big red channel so we can Creates this big red channel so we can appreciate details. And also there's appreciate details. And also there's appreciate details. And also there's going to be a lot of other details here going to be a lot of other details here going to be a lot of other details here that uh are missing with the small that uh are missing with the small that uh are missing with the small objects. So I'm going to bring a render objects. So I'm going to bring a render objects. So I'm going to bring a render region in. And then we're going to go region in. And then we're going to go region in. And then we're going to go here to the normal lights and let's get here to the normal lights and let's get here to the normal lights and let's get an area light going. So, I want the an area light going. So, I want the an area light going. So, I want the lighting to come in. If we're looking at the to come in. If we're looking at the to come in. If we're looking at the camera, I want the lighting to hit this camera, I want the lighting to hit this camera, I want the lighting to hit this direction. direction. direction. So, I'm going to switch this light over So, I'm going to switch this light over So, I'm going to switch this light over to a disc. to a disc. to a disc. Hit R twice. Going to scale it up a little bit. Going to scale it up a little bit. Going to scale it up a little bit. Bring that brightness up. I'm going to Bring that brightness up. I'm going to Bring that brightness up. I'm going to bring that spread in a little bit bring that spread in a little bit bring that spread in a little bit because what I want is some areas of because what I want is some areas of because what I want is some areas of contrast. And actually, we're going to contrast. And actually, we're going to contrast. And actually, we're going to make this light smaller. make this light smaller. make this light smaller. What I want is some points of contrast What I want is some points of contrast What I want is some points of contrast where the light is uh not quite as where the light is uh not quite as where the light is uh not quite as present. So, we'll just shrink him a little bit. So, we'll just shrink him a little bit. So, we'll just shrink him a little bit. We're make make him a lot darker and We're make make him a lot darker and We're make make him a lot darker and we're going to make him a light green. we're going to make him a light green. we're going to make him a light green. Okay. So, now we can go back to looking Okay. So, now we can go back to looking Okay. So, now we can go back to looking at our materials because now the light at our materials because now the light at our materials because now the light you can see, you can't really tell the you can see, you can't really tell the you can see, you can't really tell the details here, but you can see details details here, but you can see details details here, but you can see details here. So that is uh the big reason we here. So that is uh the big reason we here. So that is uh the big reason we want to set up our lighting now. And all want to set up our lighting now. And all want to set up our lighting now. And all of our lighting decisions of our lighting decisions of our lighting decisions greatly affect what's going on here. greatly affect what's going on here. greatly affect what's going on here. So we're going to get this roughness So we're going to get this roughness So we're going to get this roughness pretty high. So I'm going to bring this pretty high. So I'm going to bring this pretty high. So I'm going to bring this in. So notice we can start to make out in. So notice we can start to make out in. So notice we can start to make out these details these details these details in the noise texture in the noise texture in the noise texture like that. Now let's go ahead and make like that. Now let's go ahead and make like that. Now let's go ahead and make another pattern. So we're going to get a another pattern. So we're going to get a another pattern. So we're going to get a voronoi. voronoi. voronoi. We're going to plug vector here. I'm We're going to plug vector here. I'm We're going to plug vector here. I'm going to go from uklitian to chbbyev. going to go from uklitian to chbbyev. going to go from uklitian to chbbyev. And we're going to go to F2. And we're going to go to F2. And we're going to go to F2. Let's get a color ramp as well. I'm just Let's get a color ramp as well. I'm just Let's get a color ramp as well. I'm just going to highlight these and hit G to going to highlight these and hit G to going to highlight these and hit G to move them back. And let's plug move them back. And let's plug move them back. And let's plug everything here. And then let's bring everything here. And then let's bring everything here. And then let's bring that factor over so we can just look at that factor over so we can just look at that factor over so we can just look at that. So we see this really cool that. So we see this really cool that. So we see this really cool pattern. I'm going to bring the scale pattern. I'm going to bring the scale pattern. I'm going to bring the scale up quite a bit. Let's bring this Let's up quite a bit. Let's bring this Let's up quite a bit. Let's bring this Let's bring the color ramp in so we can see bring the color ramp in so we can see bring the color ramp in so we can see more of these details. And then more of these details. And then more of these details. And then if we zoom in here and we play with the if we zoom in here and we play with the if we zoom in here and we play with the detail slider, there's a lot of really detail slider, there's a lot of really detail slider, there's a lot of really cool cool cool details we can now have access to and details we can now have access to and details we can now have access to and make something really cool with. So make something really cool with. So make something really cool with. So that's pretty cool and detailed. So then that's pretty cool and detailed. So then that's pretty cool and detailed. So then if you bring this factor to the middle, if you bring this factor to the middle, if you bring this factor to the middle, you can mix the roughness, you can see you can mix the roughness, you can see you can mix the roughness, you can see with the noise. So you get this nice with the noise. So you get this nice with the noise. So you get this nice combination of the two. So we like that. combination of the two. So we like that. combination of the two. So we like that. and it really highlights over here. So and it really highlights over here. So and it really highlights over here. So now we have like the roughness portion. now we have like the roughness portion. now we have like the roughness portion. We have some interesting details here, We have some interesting details here, We have some interesting details here, especially in the highlights. But let's especially in the highlights. But let's especially in the highlights. But let's go ahead and get a bump node so we can go ahead and get a bump node so we can go ahead and get a bump node so we can start to get some more void voronoi start to get some more void voronoi start to get some more void voronoi patterns that actually interact with the patterns that actually interact with the patterns that actually interact with the lighting. So if I plug bump into normal, lighting. So if I plug bump into normal, lighting. So if I plug bump into normal, we're just going to get a brand new we're just going to get a brand new we're just going to get a brand new voroi texture. Plug that vector right voroi texture. Plug that vector right voroi texture. Plug that vector right into there. And then plug color into into there. And then plug color into into there. And then plug color into height. And you're not going to see height. And you're not going to see height. And you're not going to see much. If this is your first time dealing much. If this is your first time dealing much. If this is your first time dealing with this new update, play with the with this new update, play with the with this new update, play with the filter width, and that's going to make filter width, and that's going to make filter width, and that's going to make those cracks a lot more visible. So, those cracks a lot more visible. So, those cracks a lot more visible. So, we're going to go to chvy, we're going to go to chvy, we're going to go to chvy, bring the scale up on this one, and bring the scale up on this one, and bring the scale up on this one, and again, bring up that filter width, and again, bring up that filter width, and again, bring up that filter width, and you're going to get a more dramatic look you're going to get a more dramatic look you're going to get a more dramatic look on that pattern. And that's what we're on that pattern. And that's what we're on that pattern. And that's what we're looking for there. And then what I want looking for there. And then what I want looking for there. And then what I want to do, we're going to get a mix color, to do, we're going to get a mix color, to do, we're going to get a mix color, and we're going to mix two different and we're going to mix two different and we're going to mix two different patterns together. So, I'm going to patterns together. So, I'm going to patterns together. So, I'm going to bring the factor over to the right and bring the factor over to the right and bring the factor over to the right and get I'm going to hit control shift D. get I'm going to hit control shift D. get I'm going to hit control shift D. Get a brand new Voronoi. And I hit Get a brand new Voronoi. And I hit Get a brand new Voronoi. And I hit control shift D so that it plugs that control shift D so that it plugs that control shift D so that it plugs that mapping into the vector. What I want to mapping into the vector. What I want to mapping into the vector. What I want to do now is just bring up the scale. We're do now is just bring up the scale. We're do now is just bring up the scale. We're going to go to an F2. And then again, going to go to an F2. And then again, going to go to an F2. And then again, you can play with that detail to get you can play with that detail to get you can play with that detail to get more or less detail depending on how you more or less detail depending on how you more or less detail depending on how you want it to look. So now we have on the want it to look. So now we have on the want it to look. So now we have on the mix this mix this mix this and that. And here's a really cool trick and that. And here's a really cool trick and that. And here's a really cool trick I really love to do with Voronoi is I'm I really love to do with Voronoi is I'm I really love to do with Voronoi is I'm going to get a color ramp. going to get a color ramp. going to get a color ramp. Switch this color ramp to uh constant so Switch this color ramp to uh constant so Switch this color ramp to uh constant so there's no soft gradient between these there's no soft gradient between these there's no soft gradient between these two details and this Voro texture with two details and this Voro texture with two details and this Voro texture with the big scale the with the value of 2.1. the big scale the with the value of 2.1. the big scale the with the value of 2.1. Plug that right into there and then plug Plug that right into there and then plug Plug that right into there and then plug this into the factor and it's going to this into the factor and it's going to this into the factor and it's going to segment out segment out segment out where that really detailed section is where that really detailed section is where that really detailed section is going to show up. And then you can just going to show up. And then you can just going to show up. And then you can just go to a 4D and play with a seed value of go to a 4D and play with a seed value of go to a 4D and play with a seed value of where that is going to be. Actually, where that is going to be. Actually, where that is going to be. Actually, this is really cool right here actually. this is really cool right here actually. this is really cool right here actually. So, we can just play around. So, this is So, we can just play around. So, this is So, we can just play around. So, this is really nice. It's We have some really really nice. It's We have some really really nice. It's We have some really cool detail. In fact, I think the filter cool detail. In fact, I think the filter cool detail. In fact, I think the filter is really strong. I think I'm going to is really strong. I think I'm going to is really strong. I think I'm going to bring that down. Okay, cool. So, now we bring that down. Okay, cool. So, now we bring that down. Okay, cool. So, now we have this. What I want to do now is to have this. What I want to do now is to have this. What I want to do now is to play around with a little bit of play around with a little bit of play around with a little bit of emission on this material as well. emission on this material as well. emission on this material as well. So we can get some light in these really So we can get some light in these really So we can get some light in these really highly detailed portions. So what we're highly detailed portions. So what we're highly detailed portions. So what we're going to do is we're going to get going to do is we're going to get going to do is we're going to get another mix color. We're going to make another mix color. We're going to make another mix color. We're going to make this one black. We're going to get a this one black. We're going to get a this one black. We're going to get a color ramp. color ramp. color ramp. Plug that into B and make this that red. Plug that into B and make this that red. Plug that into B and make this that red. So what we're going to do going to bring So what we're going to do going to bring So what we're going to do going to bring that color back up. that color back up. that color back up. Make that red. And let's plug this color Make that red. And let's plug this color Make that red. And let's plug this color with the really high scale into there. with the really high scale into there. with the really high scale into there. So now you can see So now you can see So now you can see that happening. that happening. that happening. And then we're going to plug this color And then we're going to plug this color And then we're going to plug this color ramp right into the factor. And it's ramp right into the factor. And it's ramp right into the factor. And it's going to isolate that emission to those going to isolate that emission to those going to isolate that emission to those spots with the really cool high detail. spots with the really cool high detail. spots with the really cool high detail. And so now what I'm going to do is I'm And so now what I'm going to do is I'm And so now what I'm going to do is I'm just going to switch this from linear to just going to switch this from linear to just going to switch this from linear to constant and decide how much light constant and decide how much light constant and decide how much light I want in this scene. And there we go. I want in this scene. And there we go. I want in this scene. And there we go. Now we have all of this working Now we have all of this working Now we have all of this working together. and looking really cool. Now, together. and looking really cool. Now, together. and looking really cool. Now, let's deal with the let's deal with the let's deal with the flat portion of this tutorial. So, let's flat portion of this tutorial. So, let's flat portion of this tutorial. So, let's go ahead and get another mix color for go ahead and get another mix color for go ahead and get another mix color for here. This is probably my favorite part here. This is probably my favorite part here. This is probably my favorite part of this tutorial. So, let's get this mix of this tutorial. So, let's get this mix of this tutorial. So, let's get this mix color here. Plug that there. We'll get a color here. Plug that there. We'll get a color here. Plug that there. We'll get a color ramp. color ramp. color ramp. Plug that on the bottom and make this Plug that on the bottom and make this Plug that on the bottom and make this portion black and this part of the color portion black and this part of the color portion black and this part of the color ramp a nice red just like we've been ramp a nice red just like we've been ramp a nice red just like we've been dealing with. So, what we're going to do dealing with. So, what we're going to do dealing with. So, what we're going to do now is get a wave texture and then get a now is get a wave texture and then get a now is get a wave texture and then get a CtrlT CtrlT CtrlT mapping setup and plug that here. So, mapping setup and plug that here. So, mapping setup and plug that here. So, I'm going to switch this over to Y and I'm going to switch this over to Y and I'm going to switch this over to Y and then bring that keep that scale then bring that keep that scale then bring that keep that scale something like this. And now, let's go something like this. And now, let's go something like this. And now, let's go ahead get another color ramp and another ahead get another color ramp and another ahead get another color ramp and another wave texture. And we're going to make wave texture. And we're going to make wave texture. And we're going to make something really cool. Let's plug something really cool. Let's plug something really cool. Let's plug mapping here, color here, and then color mapping here, color here, and then color mapping here, color here, and then color into the factor. and it's going to make into the factor. and it's going to make into the factor. and it's going to make this really cool looking scene. So, what this really cool looking scene. So, what this really cool looking scene. So, what I can do here on the color ramp is I'm I can do here on the color ramp is I'm I can do here on the color ramp is I'm going to copy this color just by hitting going to copy this color just by hitting going to copy this color just by hitting Ctrl + C, click that, Ctrl +V, and then Ctrl + C, click that, Ctrl +V, and then Ctrl + C, click that, Ctrl +V, and then bringing that down. And then I'm just bringing that down. And then I'm just bringing that down. And then I'm just going to bring the scale up, bring the going to bring the scale up, bring the going to bring the scale up, bring the scale down on this. scale down on this. scale down on this. And you get this really interesting And you get this really interesting And you get this really interesting color variation. And so now it's going color variation. And so now it's going color variation. And so now it's going to leave you with multiple ways to to leave you with multiple ways to to leave you with multiple ways to animate with the phase offset. So you animate with the phase offset. So you animate with the phase offset. So you can animate the location phase offset can animate the location phase offset can animate the location phase offset there and the phase offset here. And it there and the phase offset here. And it there and the phase offset here. And it does create this really interesting kind does create this really interesting kind does create this really interesting kind of visually makes it look like it widens of visually makes it look like it widens of visually makes it look like it widens and shrinks. Now that's cool. I do want and shrinks. Now that's cool. I do want and shrinks. Now that's cool. I do want even more detail in this color. I want even more detail in this color. I want even more detail in this color. I want more variation. And rather than doing more variation. And rather than doing more variation. And rather than doing that through color, we can do that that through color, we can do that that through color, we can do that through strength of emission. So what we through strength of emission. So what we through strength of emission. So what we can do is get a map range instead of a can do is get a map range instead of a can do is get a map range instead of a color ramp. The reason why we're using a color ramp. The reason why we're using a color ramp. The reason why we're using a map range cuz I want to deal with values map range cuz I want to deal with values map range cuz I want to deal with values and not uh I want to use numerical and not uh I want to use numerical and not uh I want to use numerical values and not color values so that we values and not color values so that we values and not color values so that we can be a little bit more uh exact and can be a little bit more uh exact and can be a little bit more uh exact and have some some control. And then I'm have some some control. And then I'm have some some control. And then I'm going to get a voronoi texture with its going to get a voronoi texture with its going to get a voronoi texture with its own mapping setup cuz we want to be able own mapping setup cuz we want to be able own mapping setup cuz we want to be able to manipulate that here. And then we'll to manipulate that here. And then we'll to manipulate that here. And then we'll plug color right into value. It's going plug color right into value. It's going plug color right into value. It's going to do that. And then I'm going to switch to do that. And then I'm going to switch to do that. And then I'm going to switch this to this to this to chby and stretch it out chby and stretch it out chby and stretch it out like this. like this. like this. And then we can play with that minimum And then we can play with that minimum And then we can play with that minimum and that maximum to provide and that maximum to provide and that maximum to provide even more even more even more detail on the ground portion which again detail on the ground portion which again detail on the ground portion which again provides another opportunity for provides another opportunity for provides another opportunity for animation. I didn't animate it in mine animation. I didn't animate it in mine animation. I didn't animate it in mine but that's you can totally do it in but that's you can totally do it in but that's you can totally do it in yours. Now notice this really hard edge yours. Now notice this really hard edge yours. Now notice this really hard edge that the voroi is creating. I don't that the voroi is creating. I don't that the voroi is creating. I don't prefer that. So, I'm going to go here to prefer that. So, I'm going to go here to prefer that. So, I'm going to go here to a smooth F1. I'm going to bring that a smooth F1. I'm going to bring that a smooth F1. I'm going to bring that smoothness down to bring it back to smoothness down to bring it back to smoothness down to bring it back to where it was. And then just smoothen a where it was. And then just smoothen a where it was. And then just smoothen a little bit. What I want is just a little little bit. What I want is just a little little bit. What I want is just a little bit more bit more bit more uh brightness variation. Cuz if we just uh brightness variation. Cuz if we just uh brightness variation. Cuz if we just have nothing, we have this still cool have nothing, we have this still cool have nothing, we have this still cool but boring kind of wave. If we add this, but boring kind of wave. If we add this, but boring kind of wave. If we add this, it just brings an extra level of detail it just brings an extra level of detail it just brings an extra level of detail that I really, really like. And then that I really, really like. And then that I really, really like. And then what I'm going to do is just go ahead what I'm going to do is just go ahead what I'm going to do is just go ahead and even out and even out and even out some colors here. some colors here. some colors here. And there we go. Now your maximum And there we go. Now your maximum And there we go. Now your maximum emission is right here on the two max in emission is right here on the two max in emission is right here on the two max in case you kind of lose it. And then here case you kind of lose it. And then here case you kind of lose it. And then here on the wireframe, we're just going to on the wireframe, we're just going to on the wireframe, we're just going to bring that brightness up a little bit bring that brightness up a little bit bring that brightness up a little bit too. too. too. So let's go back to geometry nodes and So let's go back to geometry nodes and So let's go back to geometry nodes and I'm going to go here on this value. I'm I'm going to go here on this value. I'm I'm going to go here on this value. I'm just going to plug this value right here just going to plug this value right here just going to plug this value right here into the density. It's going to bring into the density. It's going to bring into the density. It's going to bring all those guys back and now we can look all those guys back and now we can look all those guys back and now we can look at it in the layout. So this is our at it in the layout. So this is our at it in the layout. So this is our scene. Last thing I want to do, bring scene. Last thing I want to do, bring scene. Last thing I want to do, bring the world to black. Go to my volume and the world to black. Go to my volume and the world to black. Go to my volume and give it a principled volume node and give it a principled volume node and give it a principled volume node and just give a little bit of volume into just give a little bit of volume into just give a little bit of volume into the scene. It's hard to pull to make the scene. It's hard to pull to make the scene. It's hard to pull to make out. So what I'm going to do to give out. So what I'm going to do to give out. So what I'm going to do to give this a little bit more style is put a this a little bit more style is put a this a little bit more style is put a point light right over here. point light right over here. point light right over here. So I'm going hit shift A. So, I'm going to hit shift A, get a So, I'm going to hit shift A, get a So, I'm going to hit shift A, get a point light, hit G, and move it over point light, hit G, and move it over point light, hit G, and move it over here, and then give it a brightness of here, and then give it a brightness of here, and then give it a brightness of like 800. That's 8,000. like 800. That's 8,000. like 800. That's 8,000. And then make it a nice red. And so that And then make it a nice red. And so that And then make it a nice red. And so that is going to conflict with this green is going to conflict with this green is going to conflict with this green light over here that I'm going to light over here that I'm going to light over here that I'm going to saturate a little bit more. saturate a little bit more. saturate a little bit more. There we go. So now the volume is going There we go. So now the volume is going There we go. So now the volume is going to feel a little bit more full. This to feel a little bit more full. This to feel a little bit more full. This whole scene is going to feel a little whole scene is going to feel a little whole scene is going to feel a little bit better. So, I'm going to render this bit better. So, I'm going to render this bit better. So, I'm going to render this once and we can see how this looks. And once and we can see how this looks. And once and we can see how this looks. And here we have it, our final piece. here we have it, our final piece. here we have it, our final piece. There's a lot of little details that you There's a lot of little details that you There's a lot of little details that you can go back and refine. Uh, it feels can go back and refine. Uh, it feels can go back and refine. Uh, it feels obviously with the tutorials you're obviously with the tutorials you're obviously with the tutorials you're running and running, but take your time running and running, but take your time running and running, but take your time and adjust things like the size of the and adjust things like the size of the and adjust things like the size of the wireframe, how the roughness looks, how wireframe, how the roughness looks, how wireframe, how the roughness looks, how bright things are, the lighting, bright things are, the lighting, bright things are, the lighting, everything can be improved with designs everything can be improved with designs everything can be improved with designs like this. You can have a lot of fun like this. You can have a lot of fun like this. You can have a lot of fun with it. But this is the full idea and with it. But this is the full idea and with it. But this is the full idea and that's how you do it. So, there you go. that's how you do it. So, there you go. that's how you do it. So, there you go. That's how you create this really That's how you create this really That's how you create this really beautiful render. a lot of really cool beautiful render. a lot of really cool beautiful render. a lot of really cool things that you can apply to other things that you can apply to other things that you can apply to other designs and other renders. Again, if you designs and other renders. Again, if you designs and other renders.
