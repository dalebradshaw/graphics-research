## Summary
After watching tutorials for a few years you might start to loose interest in them and they stop being useful.

## Notes
After watching tutorials for a few years you might start to loose interest in them and they stop being useful. And if you are not careful you can start to slow you learning down and hit a roadblock. When it came to me getting better at motion graphics in blender, this exact thing happened to me. Today i want to show you my method to self teach and move past being reliant on tutorials. ----------------------------- Patreon - https://patreon.com/user?u=9011118&utm_medium=clipboard_copy&utm_source=copyLink&utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator&utm_content=join_link ----------------------------------------------- 🌐 Connect with me: - Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/ducky3d/ - Twitter: https://twitter.com/Ducky3d

All right, here's the scenario. You've All right, here's the scenario. You've All right, here's the scenario. You've been watching tutorials for 1, two, been watching tutorials for 1, two, been watching tutorials for 1, two, maybe three or more years, and now they maybe three or more years, and now they maybe three or more years, and now they just don't seem to be challenging to you just don't seem to be challenging to you just don't seem to be challenging to you anymore, or just aren't quite as anymore, or just aren't quite as anymore, or just aren't quite as interesting as they used to feel. And interesting as they used to feel. And interesting as they used to feel. And now you're at a place where you're just now you're at a place where you're just now you're at a place where you're just not progressing anymore. You know that not progressing anymore. You know that not progressing anymore. You know that there's a lot more to learn, but you there's a lot more to learn, but you there's a lot more to learn, but you can't find it, and tutorials just aren't can't find it, and tutorials just aren't can't find it, and tutorials just aren't offering the things that scratch your offering the things that scratch your offering the things that scratch your itch. I have found myself in that itch. I have found myself in that itch. I have found myself in that position before and I want to show you a position before and I want to show you a position before and I want to show you a technique that I did all of 2024 and it technique that I did all of 2024 and it technique that I did all of 2024 and it really improved my work and my craft so really improved my work and my craft so really improved my work and my craft so much. First, I think it's important to much. First, I think it's important to much. First, I think it's important to understand how this happens if we're understand how this happens if we're understand how this happens if we're able to understand it and move past it. able to understand it and move past it. able to understand it and move past it. At their core, tutorials offer problems At their core, tutorials offer problems At their core, tutorials offer problems and solutions in a single piece of and solutions in a single piece of and solutions in a single piece of content, which allows you to go from content, which allows you to go from content, which allows you to go from being reliant on tutorials to be able to being reliant on tutorials to be able to being reliant on tutorials to be able to make anything to being able to remember make anything to being able to remember make anything to being able to remember all that stuff and make things that you all that stuff and make things that you all that stuff and make things that you come up with yourself. Now, problems come up with yourself. Now, problems come up with yourself. Now, problems that tutorials solve or say, hey, this that tutorials solve or say, hey, this that tutorials solve or say, hey, this is a design, an environment, whatever. is a design, an environment, whatever. is a design, an environment, whatever. I'm going to show you how to make it. I'm going to show you how to make it. I'm going to show you how to make it. You don't know how to make it. This You don't know how to make it. This You don't know how to make it. This video will show you that. Or say, hey, I video will show you that. Or say, hey, I video will show you that. Or say, hey, I don't know how to make a cloth don't know how to make a cloth don't know how to make a cloth simulation. That's the problem. the simulation. That's the problem. the simulation. That's the problem. the video will solve it. Now, after a couple video will solve it. Now, after a couple video will solve it. Now, after a couple years of doing this, those tutorials years of doing this, those tutorials years of doing this, those tutorials just stop being useful. You stop really just stop being useful. You stop really just stop being useful. You stop really needing the ones that keep getting needing the ones that keep getting needing the ones that keep getting uploaded or the ones that have existed uploaded or the ones that have existed uploaded or the ones that have existed for a long time. And that's exactly what for a long time. And that's exactly what for a long time. And that's exactly what had been happening to me for quite a had been happening to me for quite a had been happening to me for quite a while. And I felt stagnant. I felt like while. And I felt stagnant. I felt like while. And I felt stagnant. I felt like I wasn't learning anything new yet. I I wasn't learning anything new yet. I I wasn't learning anything new yet. I saw a lot of work that I didn't know how saw a lot of work that I didn't know how saw a lot of work that I didn't know how to do. And I knew there was things to to do. And I knew there was things to to do. And I knew there was things to learn, but I was too reliant on YouTube learn, but I was too reliant on YouTube learn, but I was too reliant on YouTube tutorials and courses. So, how did I tutorials and courses. So, how did I tutorials and courses. So, how did I move past this? I did thematic studies move past this? I did thematic studies move past this? I did thematic studies of large groups of work with the goal of of large groups of work with the goal of of large groups of work with the goal of studying them enough to find things that studying them enough to find things that studying them enough to find things that I don't know how to do. First, I have to I don't know how to do. First, I have to I don't know how to do. First, I have to pick a topic. I have to collect the pick a topic. I have to collect the pick a topic. I have to collect the inspiration on that topic. Then, I have inspiration on that topic. Then, I have inspiration on that topic. Then, I have to start looking at those images and to start looking at those images and to start looking at those images and videos and start getting challenged. The videos and start getting challenged. The videos and start getting challenged. The goal here is to make a lot of project goal here is to make a lot of project goal here is to make a lot of project files. You don't have to finish them, files. You don't have to finish them, files. You don't have to finish them, but find things that really challenge but find things that really challenge but find things that really challenge you. Then after a lot of R&D, distill you. Then after a lot of R&D, distill you. Then after a lot of R&D, distill all of this work into five really cool all of this work into five really cool all of this work into five really cool images that feel like they fit within images that feel like they fit within images that feel like they fit within the work that you collected for this the work that you collected for this the work that you collected for this project. Now, I mentioned I did this all project. Now, I mentioned I did this all project. Now, I mentioned I did this all of 2024. There were a ton of videos that of 2024. There were a ton of videos that of 2024. There were a ton of videos that I uploaded that year that were I uploaded that year that were I uploaded that year that were breakdowns of projects. Those projects breakdowns of projects. Those projects breakdowns of projects. Those projects came from those self-appointed research came from those self-appointed research came from those self-appointed research and development sprints that I did. I and development sprints that I did. I and development sprints that I did. I would make those boards and really study would make those boards and really study would make those boards and really study them and they would challenge me. I'm them and they would challenge me. I'm them and they would challenge me. I'm going to use this video as an example to going to use this video as an example to going to use this video as an example to show you how I did all that. This video show you how I did all that. This video show you how I did all that. This video was called the power of curves and this was called the power of curves and this was called the power of curves and this was a product of learning really cool was a product of learning really cool was a product of learning really cool things. I wanted to see how far I can things. I wanted to see how far I can things. I wanted to see how far I can take using geometry nodes with curves to take using geometry nodes with curves to take using geometry nodes with curves to make really beautiful animations. So, make really beautiful animations. So, make really beautiful animations. So, first I collected a Pinterest boards of first I collected a Pinterest boards of first I collected a Pinterest boards of just images that I thought were cool. just images that I thought were cool. just images that I thought were cool. Don't pick images that you think you Don't pick images that you think you Don't pick images that you think you know how to do. Just pick images that know how to do. Just pick images that know how to do. Just pick images that you think are cool cuz that will lead you think are cool cuz that will lead you think are cool cuz that will lead you to roadblocks. Let's take this you to roadblocks. Let's take this you to roadblocks. Let's take this animation for example. I wanted to make animation for example. I wanted to make animation for example. I wanted to make something that kind of looked like an something that kind of looked like an something that kind of looked like an eyeball of curves. So, the first thing I eyeball of curves. So, the first thing I eyeball of curves. So, the first thing I didn't know how to do was how to array didn't know how to do was how to array didn't know how to do was how to array all of those curves in a circular all of those curves in a circular all of those curves in a circular pattern and have them point outward. So, pattern and have them point outward. So, pattern and have them point outward. So, that was a rabbit hole that I had to go that was a rabbit hole that I had to go that was a rabbit hole that I had to go down to to learn how to basically point down to to learn how to basically point down to to learn how to basically point things out based on the normal. Then, I things out based on the normal. Then, I things out based on the normal. Then, I had to figure out how to displace them had to figure out how to displace them had to figure out how to displace them properly, how to get those curves to properly, how to get those curves to properly, how to get those curves to actually move in a way that I wanted and actually move in a way that I wanted and actually move in a way that I wanted and controlled. And I didn't understand how controlled. And I didn't understand how controlled. And I didn't understand how to do that. That was more research that to do that. That was more research that to do that. That was more research that I had to do. Then I had to learn how to I had to do. Then I had to learn how to I had to do. Then I had to learn how to get light to properly move up and down get light to properly move up and down get light to properly move up and down these curves and how to randomly place these curves and how to randomly place these curves and how to randomly place those lights. So, not all the curves had those lights. So, not all the curves had those lights. So, not all the curves had those moving lights on them. All of those moving lights on them. All of those moving lights on them. All of those things were things I did not know those things were things I did not know those things were things I did not know how to do. I had to go through Blender how to do. I had to go through Blender how to do. I had to go through Blender subreddits and forums and a lot of hair subreddits and forums and a lot of hair subreddits and forums and a lot of hair pulling to figure these things out and pulling to figure these things out and pulling to figure these things out and it resulted in one of my absolute it resulted in one of my absolute it resulted in one of my absolute favorite animations I've ever done. favorite animations I've ever done. favorite animations I've ever done. Another really cool and kind of simple Another really cool and kind of simple Another really cool and kind of simple problem solving was I found this image problem solving was I found this image problem solving was I found this image and I wanted to make something similar and I wanted to make something similar and I wanted to make something similar to it. So my first task was was to take to it. So my first task was was to take to it. So my first task was was to take curves and have smaller and smaller curves and have smaller and smaller curves and have smaller and smaller smaller ones moving inwards first to be smaller ones moving inwards first to be smaller ones moving inwards first to be able to displace them. I did not know able to displace them. I did not know able to displace them. I did not know how to do that in geometry nodes which how to do that in geometry nodes which how to do that in geometry nodes which led me to figuring out how to use led me to figuring out how to use led me to figuring out how to use simulation nodes in a very simple way to simulation nodes in a very simple way to simulation nodes in a very simple way to get them to sort of array inward. And get them to sort of array inward. And get them to sort of array inward. And then all I had to do was displace them then all I had to do was displace them then all I had to do was displace them and figure out some things that I and figure out some things that I and figure out some things that I already knew how to do. But it it taught already knew how to do. But it it taught already knew how to do. But it it taught me how to use a really simple tool which me how to use a really simple tool which me how to use a really simple tool which is the simulation nodes very is the simulation nodes very is the simulation nodes very primitively. Now this one I was really primitively. Now this one I was really primitively. Now this one I was really inspired by. I wanted to figure out how inspired by. I wanted to figure out how inspired by. I wanted to figure out how to take a big sort of array of curves to take a big sort of array of curves to take a big sort of array of curves and just sort of like make them move and just sort of like make them move and just sort of like make them move around uh kind of like something you around uh kind of like something you around uh kind of like something you would see in the ocean. So, first would see in the ocean. So, first would see in the ocean. So, first because I figured out how to use because I figured out how to use because I figured out how to use simulation nodes to create an array, I simulation nodes to create an array, I simulation nodes to create an array, I created an array of those curves, then I created an array of those curves, then I created an array of those curves, then I was able to displace these guys. But the was able to displace these guys. But the was able to displace these guys. But the problem was the bottoms of them were problem was the bottoms of them were problem was the bottoms of them were moving with the displacement, which moving with the displacement, which moving with the displacement, which meant I had to figure out how to isolate meant I had to figure out how to isolate meant I had to figure out how to isolate the displacement only to the top the displacement only to the top the displacement only to the top portion, which led me to figuring out portion, which led me to figuring out portion, which led me to figuring out how to use position information to how to use position information to how to use position information to isolate the bottom to keep it still and isolate the bottom to keep it still and isolate the bottom to keep it still and have the top only move and have some have the top only move and have some have the top only move and have some control. That took a little bit of R&D control. That took a little bit of R&D control. That took a little bit of R&D on my end to understand vector math, on my end to understand vector math, on my end to understand vector math, understand position, and how to mix understand position, and how to mix understand position, and how to mix things together in order to get that to things together in order to get that to things together in order to get that to look nice. Now, I did this multiple look nice. Now, I did this multiple look nice. Now, I did this multiple times and I'm even working on the next times and I'm even working on the next times and I'm even working on the next one, which is all about recreating one, which is all about recreating one, which is all about recreating really cool sci-fi looking things. And really cool sci-fi looking things. And really cool sci-fi looking things. And there will be a lot of things that I there will be a lot of things that I there will be a lot of things that I learned from that that will turn into learned from that that will turn into learned from that that will turn into tutorials that I put on this channel. tutorials that I put on this channel. tutorials that I put on this channel. So, it not only benefits me personally, So, it not only benefits me personally, So, it not only benefits me personally, it benefits the YouTube channel. It it benefits the YouTube channel. It it benefits the YouTube channel. It benefits the Patreon because all of benefits the Patreon because all of benefits the Patreon because all of these projects I ended up putting on these projects I ended up putting on these projects I ended up putting on Patreon. And like I said, I'm distilling Patreon. And like I said, I'm distilling Patreon. And like I said, I'm distilling I'm creating five or so images from each I'm creating five or so images from each I'm creating five or so images from each one and those turn into tutorials for one and those turn into tutorials for one and those turn into tutorials for everything that I'm doing. So, for me everything that I'm doing. So, for me everything that I'm doing. So, for me personally, it's been a huge huge personally, it's been a huge huge personally, it's been a huge huge benefit. and you as an artist doing benefit. and you as an artist doing benefit. and you as an artist doing whatever you want to do with your art. I whatever you want to do with your art. I whatever you want to do with your art. I also think it is going to be a huge huge also think it is going to be a huge huge also think it is going to be a huge huge benefit to do these kind of sprints. So benefit to do these kind of sprints. So benefit to do these kind of sprints. So to summarize this process, it goes to to summarize this process, it goes to to summarize this process, it goes to picking a topic, collecting inspiration picking a topic, collecting inspiration picking a topic, collecting inspiration on that topic. Get as much as you can, on that topic. Get as much as you can, on that topic. Get as much as you can, then start diving into the things that then start diving into the things that then start diving into the things that you think are interesting and start you think are interesting and start you think are interesting and start getting challenged and make a lot of getting challenged and make a lot of getting challenged and make a lot of different project files. Then once different project files. Then once different project files. Then once you've gone through the ringer of you've gone through the ringer of you've gone through the ringer of research and Reddits and YouTubes and research and Reddits and YouTubes and research and Reddits and YouTubes and all of the hair pulling frustration of all of the hair pulling frustration of all of the hair pulling frustration of learning things you don't know how to learning things you don't know how to learning things you don't know how to do, distill those into five really cool do, distill those into five really cool do, distill those into five really cool designs that you can be proud of and put designs that you can be proud of and put designs that you can be proud of and put on your portfolio, your Instagram, your on your portfolio, your Instagram, your on your portfolio, your Instagram, your own work, doing whatever you want. I own work, doing whatever you want. I own work, doing whatever you want. I would recommend doing that once a month. would recommend doing that once a month. would recommend doing that once a month. And I'm still doing that. All of my And I'm still doing that. All of my And I'm still doing that. All of my processes like this, they end up as full processes like this, they end up as full processes like this, they end up as full collections on my Patreon if you want to collections on my Patreon if you want to collections on my Patreon if you want to check that out. My Patreon is linked in check that out. My Patreon is linked in check that out. My Patreon is linked in the description. And every single month the description. And every single month the description. And every single month I've been putting out these projects of I've been putting out these projects of I've been putting out these projects of really learning things and giving really learning things and giving really learning things and giving everyone those new topics. But it everyone those new topics. But it everyone those new topics. But it doesn't all stay on Patreon. The YouTube doesn't all stay on Patreon. The YouTube doesn't all stay on Patreon. The YouTube channel is also being populated with all channel is also being populated with all channel is also being populated with all of these research and development of these research and development of these research and development projects, too. So, you can get that projects, too. So, you can get that projects, too. So, you can get that stuff on Patreon and you can get it here stuff on Patreon and you can get it here stuff on Patreon and you can get it here on YouTube. If you want to check out the on YouTube.
