How's it going, guys? So, in this How's it going, guys? So, in this How's it going, guys? So, in this tutorial, we are going to be creating tutorial, we are going to be creating tutorial, we are going to be creating this animation right here from start to this animation right here from start to this animation right here from start to finish. It's going to be really fun. finish. It's going to be really fun. finish. It's going to be really fun. This is all going to be done in the This is all going to be done in the This is all going to be done in the shading. So, we're going to start off shading. So, we're going to start off shading. So, we're going to start off with creating a really highly detailed, with creating a really highly detailed, with creating a really highly detailed, almost woodlike looking pattern. Then, almost woodlike looking pattern. Then, almost woodlike looking pattern. Then, we're going to use some masking to cut we're going to use some masking to cut we're going to use some masking to cut out some of that shape so we can start out some of that shape so we can start out some of that shape so we can start making some stuff that looks kind of making some stuff that looks kind of making some stuff that looks kind of like a river. Then, we're going to use like a river. Then, we're going to use like a river. Then, we're going to use some more shading tricks to take some of some more shading tricks to take some of some more shading tricks to take some of those patterns and highlight them to those patterns and highlight them to those patterns and highlight them to make them brighter so that they will make them brighter so that they will make them brighter so that they will glow and the other ones won't glow. glow and the other ones won't glow. glow and the other ones won't glow. After that, to create that topographic After that, to create that topographic After that, to create that topographic map inspiration, we are going to be map inspiration, we are going to be map inspiration, we are going to be creating a grid floor for the bottom. creating a grid floor for the bottom. creating a grid floor for the bottom. Then all we're going to have to do is Then all we're going to have to do is Then all we're going to have to do is animate the pattern, animate the camera, animate the pattern, animate the camera, animate the pattern, animate the camera, and will be completely finished. This and will be completely finished. This and will be completely finished. This animation is part of a series of animation is part of a series of animation is part of a series of tutorials here on YouTube that are tutorials here on YouTube that are tutorials here on YouTube that are inspired by topographic map art and inspired by topographic map art and inspired by topographic map art and animations. I'll be posting four of animations. I'll be posting four of animations. I'll be posting four of these tutorials backtoback here on these tutorials backtoback here on these tutorials backtoback here on YouTube. So, if you want to learn more YouTube. So, if you want to learn more YouTube.

They're all the other ones like this. They're all the other ones like this. They're all really cool and there's a lot of fun really cool and there's a lot of fun really cool and there's a lot of fun things to learn. On Patreon, I posted things to learn. On Patreon, I posted things to learn. On Patreon, I posted what I'm calling the topographic what I'm calling the topographic what I'm calling the topographic blueprint, which is an hour and 20 blueprint, which is an hour and 20 blueprint, which is an hour and 20 minutes of training of all the shading, minutes of training of all the shading, minutes of training of all the shading, geometry nodes, and animation tricks geometry nodes, and animation tricks geometry nodes, and animation tricks that are combined to make these four that are combined to make these four that are combined to make these four animations and many others. Here on animations and many others. Here on animations and many others. Here on YouTube, all those elements are combined YouTube, all those elements are combined YouTube, all those elements are combined to make really cool animations. But on to make really cool animations. But on to make really cool animations. But on Patreon, I'm showing you every Patreon, I'm showing you every Patreon, I'm showing you every individual effect and tip and trick so individual effect and tip and trick so individual effect and tip and trick so that you can combine them and make your that you can combine them and make your that you can combine them and make your own original topographic map inspired own original topographic map inspired own original topographic map inspired animations. So, if you want to check animations. So, if you want to check animations. So, if you want to check that out, that is going to be linked in that out, that is going to be linked in that out, that is going to be linked in the description and you can get a the description and you can get a the description and you can get a discount if you subscribe annually. With discount if you subscribe annually. With discount if you subscribe annually. With that being said, let's get into this that being said, let's get into this that being said, let's get into this tutorial. All right, all of this is tutorial. All right, all of this is tutorial. All right, all of this is going to be done in uh the shading. So, going to be done in uh the shading. So, going to be done in uh the shading. So, what we're going to do is I'm going hit what we're going to do is I'm going hit what we're going to do is I'm going hit shift A, get a plane. I'm going to hit shift A, get a plane. I'm going to hit shift A, get a plane. I'm going to hit S10, S10, S10, control A, apply that scale, and then control A, apply that scale, and then control A, apply that scale, and then I'm just going to go ahead and get a I'm just going to go ahead and get a I'm just going to go ahead and get a brand new window. This is going to be brand new window. This is going to be brand new window. This is going to be the 3D viewport. This is going to be the the 3D viewport. This is going to be the the 3D viewport. This is going to be the shader editor. I'm gonna hit N just to shader editor. I'm gonna hit N just to shader editor. I'm gonna hit N just to move that. I'm click new. And then right move that. I'm click new. And then right move that. I'm click new. And then right over here, we're going to go here to over here, we're going to go here to over here, we're going to go here to Eevee. I'm gonna scroll. I'm gonna click Eevee. I'm gonna scroll. I'm gonna click Eevee. I'm gonna scroll. I'm gonna click on the material settings. And uh I'm on the material settings. And uh I'm on the material settings. And uh I'm going to go here from dithered to going to go here from dithered to going to go here from dithered to blended. Make sure you do have a blended. Make sure you do have a blended. Make sure you do have a material. And then that is going to keep material. And then that is going to keep material. And then that is going to keep you from having grainy transparency. And you from having grainy transparency. And you from having grainy transparency. And then we're just going to go here to the then we're just going to go here to the then we're just going to go here to the EV view. And then in the uh compositing EV view. And then in the uh compositing EV view. And then in the uh compositing tab up here, I'm going to click use tab up here, I'm going to click use tab up here, I'm going to click use nodes. I'm going to type in glare and nodes. I'm going to type in glare and nodes. I'm going to type in glare and switch this over to fog glow. So, we'll switch this over to fog glow. So, we'll switch this over to fog glow. So, we'll go back to layout and now we can start. go back to layout and now we can start. go back to layout and now we can start. So, here on the emission, let's give it So, here on the emission, let's give it So, here on the emission, let's give it a strength of three for now so we can a strength of three for now so we can a strength of three for now so we can see what's happening. And then I'm going see what's happening. And then I'm going see what's happening. And then I'm going to hit this drop down right up here and to hit this drop down right up here and to hit this drop down right up here and click on always. That's going to turn on click on always. That's going to turn on click on always. That's going to turn on all of our compositing. So, world all of our compositing. So, world all of our compositing. So, world brightness, we'll bring that down to brightness, we'll bring that down to brightness, we'll bring that down to black. Let's get a color ramp and let's black. Let's get a color ramp and let's black. Let's get a color ramp and let's plug that color ramp into the color and plug that color ramp into the color and plug that color ramp into the color and pick our final output color. something pick our final output color. something pick our final output color. something like a nice light blue. Something like like a nice light blue. Something like like a nice light blue. Something like this. Then what I'm going to do is I'm this. Then what I'm going to do is I'm this. Then what I'm going to do is I'm going to get a mix color. Plug this going to get a mix color. Plug this going to get a mix color. Plug this here. here. here. I'm going to make B black. And this is I'm going to make B black. And this is I'm going to make B black. And this is just for some things that we're going to just for some things that we're going to just for some things that we're going to need to do later. So let's go ahead and need to do later. So let's go ahead and need to do later. So let's go ahead and plug a color ramp into A. So if we bring plug a color ramp into A. So if we bring plug a color ramp into A. So if we bring factor over to the right, that's just factor over to the right, that's just factor over to the right, that's just the black. Factor over to the B, that is the black. Factor over to the B, that is the black. Factor over to the B, that is this color ramp. And let's go ahead and this color ramp. And let's go ahead and this color ramp. And let's go ahead and add in our textures. So let's get a add in our textures. So let's get a add in our textures. So let's get a noise texture. noise texture. noise texture. And let's get in a wave texture. And let's get in a wave texture. And let's get in a wave texture. Plug that in the vector. And then I'm Plug that in the vector. And then I'm Plug that in the vector. And then I'm going to hit controlT. If you have the going to hit controlT. If you have the going to hit controlT. If you have the node wrangler add-on enabled, that's node wrangler add-on enabled, that's node wrangler add-on enabled, that's that comes with Blender by default. that comes with Blender by default. that comes with Blender by default. You'll just hit control T or just go You'll just hit control T or just go You'll just hit control T or just go ahead and get a mapping node, a texture ahead and get a mapping node, a texture ahead and get a mapping node, a texture coordinate, and use the object coordinate, and use the object coordinate, and use the object coordinate. So, let's go ahead and focus coordinate. So, let's go ahead and focus coordinate. So, let's go ahead and focus on these guys. So, here on the scale of on these guys. So, here on the scale of on these guys. So, here on the scale of the noise, don't worry about that. Bring the noise, don't worry about that. Bring the noise, don't worry about that. Bring the scale of the wave texture really the scale of the wave texture really the scale of the wave texture really low. I found 0.5 looks really good. And low. I found 0.5 looks really good. And low. I found 0.5 looks really good. And if you bring this in, you'll notice some if you bring this in, you'll notice some if you bring this in, you'll notice some things changing. We now have this. If things changing. We now have this. If things changing. We now have this. If you bring up the scale of the noise, you bring up the scale of the noise, you bring up the scale of the noise, it's going to add more detail here, but it's going to add more detail here, but it's going to add more detail here, but we'll that'll be more obvious in a we'll that'll be more obvious in a we'll that'll be more obvious in a second. Let's bring our distortion second. Let's bring our distortion second. Let's bring our distortion really really high. And then our detail really really high. And then our detail really really high. And then our detail scale high as well. scale high as well. scale high as well. Something like three or four. And then Something like three or four. And then Something like three or four. And then our detail. Once we bring up the detail, our detail. Once we bring up the detail, our detail. Once we bring up the detail, we'll start to get kind of look like we'll start to get kind of look like we'll start to get kind of look like what uh looks like wood. what uh looks like wood. what uh looks like wood. So bring our detail to maybe 10. And So bring our detail to maybe 10. And So bring our detail to maybe 10. And also I'm gonna switch from sign to saw. also I'm gonna switch from sign to saw. also I'm gonna switch from sign to saw. That's just going to change it up a That's just going to change it up a That's just going to change it up a little bit. So now we have this. If we little bit. So now we have this. If we little bit. So now we have this. If we play with the phase offset, we get this play with the phase offset, we get this play with the phase offset, we get this really cool looking thing. What I want really cool looking thing. What I want really cool looking thing. What I want is this amount of detail. And again, if is this amount of detail. And again, if is this amount of detail. And again, if you play with the noise texture, you you play with the noise texture, you you play with the noise texture, you just add more and more detail into this. just add more and more detail into this. just add more and more detail into this. So play around with that. See what you So play around with that. See what you So play around with that. See what you like. I ended up settling around 13 for like. I ended up settling around 13 for like. I ended up settling around 13 for my detail. Now, the reason why we added my detail. Now, the reason why we added my detail. Now, the reason why we added this mix color rather than just maybe this mix color rather than just maybe this mix color rather than just maybe throwing it in like that and doing this throwing it in like that and doing this throwing it in like that and doing this is we need this color ramp to control is we need this color ramp to control is we need this color ramp to control these textures here. So, we can leave it these textures here. So, we can leave it these textures here. So, we can leave it like this. But what I want to do is I'm like this. But what I want to do is I'm like this. But what I want to do is I'm going to get another color ramp and I'm going to get another color ramp and I'm going to get another color ramp and I'm going to take this wave texture. If I going to take this wave texture. If I going to take this wave texture. If I just view it, that's what it looks like just view it, that's what it looks like just view it, that's what it looks like there. That's what it looks like with there. That's what it looks like with there. That's what it looks like with both of them combined. So, what I want both of them combined. So, what I want both of them combined. So, what I want to do is take just the wave texture, not to do is take just the wave texture, not to do is take just the wave texture, not the noise, but the wave. And because it the noise, but the wave. And because it the noise, but the wave. And because it is a larger texture, if I use it as a is a larger texture, if I use it as a is a larger texture, if I use it as a way to mask out, so I'll bring this over way to mask out, so I'll bring this over way to mask out, so I'll bring this over here to mask out parts of this larger here to mask out parts of this larger here to mask out parts of this larger texture, it helps make it feel a little texture, it helps make it feel a little texture, it helps make it feel a little bit more gives us some negative space, bit more gives us some negative space, bit more gives us some negative space, but we still get to enjoy the texture. but we still get to enjoy the texture. but we still get to enjoy the texture. So, what I'm going to do is I can move So, what I'm going to do is I can move So, what I'm going to do is I can move it around like that. And then if we get it around like that. And then if we get it around like that. And then if we get try testing something out here just for try testing something out here just for try testing something out here just for fun. So you have this one moving this fun. So you have this one moving this fun. So you have this one moving this way, this guy moving this way. So way, this guy moving this way. So way, this guy moving this way. So everything kind of moves in that everything kind of moves in that everything kind of moves in that direction. If I go ahead and I get direction. If I go ahead and I get direction. If I go ahead and I get another node another node another node and I make it white, and I make it white, and I make it white, what happens is I can move this one here what happens is I can move this one here what happens is I can move this one here and I can move this one here. So you can and I can move this one here. So you can and I can move this one here. So you can move it from both sides, but you still move it from both sides, but you still move it from both sides, but you still get that saw effect. And so you get get that saw effect. And so you get get that saw effect. And so you get control of both. Or make this one white control of both. Or make this one white control of both. Or make this one white and both of these black and both of these black and both of these black and it it's going to kind of cut out and it it's going to kind of cut out and it it's going to kind of cut out that middle. So, see that? that middle. So, see that? that middle. So, see that? So, you can move this around. It's going So, you can move this around. It's going So, you can move this around. It's going to cut that middle out. Now, this is not to cut that middle out. Now, this is not to cut that middle out. Now, this is not preferable, but you can see how that preferable, but you can see how that preferable, but you can see how that works. So, I'm just going to hit works. So, I'm just going to hit works. So, I'm just going to hit control-z until I have both of these. control-z until I have both of these. control-z until I have both of these. So, now we have this effect happening So, now we have this effect happening So, now we have this effect happening right here. And you can bring it in, right here. And you can bring it in, right here. And you can bring it in, crunch it in however, however much you crunch it in however, however much you crunch it in however, however much you want. And then this detail scale is want. And then this detail scale is want. And then this detail scale is going to have a lot of fun. So, play going to have a lot of fun. So, play going to have a lot of fun. So, play with your distortion with your distortion with your distortion and especially the detail scale until and especially the detail scale until and especially the detail scale until you like what you see. I'm gonna go you like what you see. I'm gonna go you like what you see. I'm gonna go ahead and delete one of these white uh ahead and delete one of these white uh ahead and delete one of these white uh nodes and just keep keep it like this. nodes and just keep keep it like this. nodes and just keep keep it like this. And so now we have a really really cool And so now we have a really really cool And so now we have a really really cool scene. And again, playing with the detail, playing with playing with the detail, playing with playing with the detail, playing with the scale of this, the scale of this, the scale of this, you can even play with the distortion of you can even play with the distortion of you can even play with the distortion of the noise and you can get a lot of the noise and you can get a lot of the noise and you can get a lot of stuff. So there's just a lot that you stuff. So there's just a lot that you stuff. So there's just a lot that you can play with and the phase offset is can play with and the phase offset is can play with and the phase offset is how this gets animated. Now what we can how this gets animated. Now what we can how this gets animated. Now what we can do now is play with the fact that we do now is play with the fact that we do now is play with the fact that we have emission strength that makes have emission strength that makes have emission strength that makes something glow. So we have this color something glow. So we have this color something glow. So we have this color amp that's creating the color. So let's amp that's creating the color. So let's amp that's creating the color. So let's go ahead and get a map range and plug go ahead and get a map range and plug go ahead and get a map range and plug the noise texture into the value and the noise texture into the value and the noise texture into the value and then plug the result into the strength. then plug the result into the strength. then plug the result into the strength. What I want to do is get a bring our max What I want to do is get a bring our max What I want to do is get a bring our max color to something that is that glows. color to something that is that glows. color to something that is that glows. And if you play with the from minimum, And if you play with the from minimum, And if you play with the from minimum, it is going to crunch that in to just it is going to crunch that in to just it is going to crunch that in to just highlight a few of these and then bring highlight a few of these and then bring highlight a few of these and then bring that minimum back to reveal the rest of that minimum back to reveal the rest of that minimum back to reveal the rest of the texture. So what this is going to do the texture. So what this is going to do the texture. So what this is going to do is bring out is bring out is bring out these middle lines and those are going these middle lines and those are going these middle lines and those are going to be only ones that glow. So then to be only ones that glow. So then to be only ones that glow. So then whenever we play with the phase offset, whenever we play with the phase offset, whenever we play with the phase offset, so let's find a spot where it looks so let's find a spot where it looks so let's find a spot where it looks really really interesting like something really really interesting like something really really interesting like something over here. When we play with the offset, over here. When we play with the offset, over here. When we play with the offset, we get this really interesting look we get this really interesting look we get this really interesting look where it's not all just everything, you where it's not all just everything, you where it's not all just everything, you know, the same brightness, right? That know, the same brightness, right? That know, the same brightness, right? That would look that's just not quite as would look that's just not quite as would look that's just not quite as interesting. But if you do it like this interesting. But if you do it like this interesting. But if you do it like this where we use this from minimum and just where we use this from minimum and just where we use this from minimum and just highlight a couple of these lines and highlight a couple of these lines and highlight a couple of these lines and then we have the rest at that color, then we have the rest at that color, then we have the rest at that color, you can create a really, really cool, you can create a really, really cool, you can create a really, really cool, really interesting looking animation really interesting looking animation really interesting looking animation with combining some textures. So now with combining some textures. So now with combining some textures. So now that we have this, you can go back and, that we have this, you can go back and, that we have this, you can go back and, you know, edit your texture even more to you know, edit your texture even more to you know, edit your texture even more to be whatever you want it to be. So play be whatever you want it to be. So play be whatever you want it to be. So play with this until you like what you see. with this until you like what you see. with this until you like what you see. And then see the alpha. So if I go here And then see the alpha. So if I go here And then see the alpha. So if I go here to scene world. So if I just go here to to scene world. So if I just go here to to scene world. So if I just go here to the material preview, you can see it's the material preview, you can see it's the material preview, you can see it's just a flat plane just a flat plane just a flat plane principled BSDF with emission on top of principled BSDF with emission on top of principled BSDF with emission on top of it. You can't see through it. And I want it. You can't see through it. And I want it. You can't see through it. And I want to add some things to the bottom. So to add some things to the bottom. So to add some things to the bottom. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to get what I'm going to do is I'm going to get what I'm going to do is I'm going to get a color ramp. I'm going to plug this a color ramp. I'm going to plug this a color ramp. I'm going to plug this into the alpha. And then I'm going to into the alpha. And then I'm going to into the alpha. And then I'm going to plug this mix into here. plug this mix into here. plug this mix into here. And that should show what we're looking And that should show what we're looking And that should show what we're looking for. You can switch it over to constant. for. You can switch it over to constant. for. You can switch it over to constant. And then bring this in to make sure And then bring this in to make sure And then bring this in to make sure everything we're seeing is what we want everything we're seeing is what we want everything we're seeing is what we want to see. You can switch it over here to to see. You can switch it over here to to see. You can switch it over here to see. Okay. Yep. The transparency is see. Okay. Yep. The transparency is see. Okay. Yep. The transparency is absolutely working. So that's what we absolutely working. So that's what we absolutely working. So that's what we want. So bring it to bring your color want. So bring it to bring your color want. So bring it to bring your color ramp to uh a constant and then just ramp to uh a constant and then just ramp to uh a constant and then just crunch it all the way over there and crunch it all the way over there and crunch it all the way over there and we're going to get transparency. So now we're going to get transparency. So now we're going to get transparency. So now that we have this the animation is of that we have this the animation is of that we have this the animation is of course going to come from the phase course going to come from the phase course going to come from the phase offset just like this. It's going to be offset just like this. It's going to be offset just like this. It's going to be a very sensitive phase offset. So let's a very sensitive phase offset. So let's a very sensitive phase offset. So let's go ahead and create a grid floor beneath go ahead and create a grid floor beneath go ahead and create a grid floor beneath it to give it that topographic map uh it to give it that topographic map uh it to give it that topographic map uh like grid detail on the bottom. So, like grid detail on the bottom. So, like grid detail on the bottom. So, let's just go ahead. I'm going to take let's just go ahead. I'm going to take let's just go ahead. I'm going to take this plane. I'm going hit shift D. I'm this plane. I'm going hit shift D. I'm this plane. I'm going hit shift D. I'm going to send it pretty far down. It going to send it pretty far down. It going to send it pretty far down. It looks like my hit some buttons I didn't looks like my hit some buttons I didn't looks like my hit some buttons I didn't want to hit. So, print send it far down want to hit. So, print send it far down want to hit. So, print send it far down like that. And then if we go back here like that. And then if we go back here like that. And then if we go back here to the view, you can see there's another to the view, you can see there's another to the view, you can see there's another map down there. I'm going to go ahead map down there. I'm going to go ahead map down there. I'm going to go ahead and just hit X. Click new. Hit the and just hit X. Click new. Hit the and just hit X. Click new. Hit the period key and give it a strength of period key and give it a strength of period key and give it a strength of like three. So, we have something down like three. So, we have something down like three. So, we have something down there. Let's just scale it up. there. Let's just scale it up. there. Let's just scale it up. I'm going to go ahead get my color ramp. I'm going to go ahead get my color ramp. I'm going to go ahead get my color ramp. Let's go ahead and plug this into the Let's go ahead and plug this into the Let's go ahead and plug this into the color. We're going to get a We're going color. We're going to get a We're going color. We're going to get a We're going to get a voroid texture and get a dot to get a voroid texture and get a dot to get a voroid texture and get a dot grid for the bottom. So, I'm just going grid for the bottom. So, I'm just going grid for the bottom. So, I'm just going to hit CtrlT, get that object to hit CtrlT, get that object to hit CtrlT, get that object coordinate, and use the distance. coordinate, and use the distance. coordinate, and use the distance. Bring random to zero. I'm going to flip Bring random to zero. I'm going to flip Bring random to zero. I'm going to flip my color ramp and then bring this in. my color ramp and then bring this in. my color ramp and then bring this in. So, now we're going to have a grid of So, now we're going to have a grid of So, now we're going to have a grid of dots going beneath it. And you can see dots going beneath it. And you can see dots going beneath it. And you can see that parallax effect, which is what that parallax effect, which is what that parallax effect, which is what we're looking for. And then we're going we're looking for. And then we're going we're looking for. And then we're going to give ourselves a nice blue. And then to give ourselves a nice blue. And then to give ourselves a nice blue. And then what I want to do is let's just go ahead what I want to do is let's just go ahead what I want to do is let's just go ahead and I'm hit shift D and get another and I'm hit shift D and get another and I'm hit shift D and get another plane right about there. Let's go back plane right about there. Let's go back plane right about there. Let's go back to the view. to the view. to the view. And notice you can see that parallax And notice you can see that parallax And notice you can see that parallax effect happening. What I want to do is effect happening. What I want to do is effect happening. What I want to do is I'm going to go back to the flat view. I'm going to go back to the flat view. I'm going to go back to the flat view. I'm going to click this bottom one. I'm I'm going to click this bottom one. I'm I'm going to click this bottom one. I'm hit shift D and then bring it up just hit shift D and then bring it up just hit shift D and then bring it up just kind of the middle portion there. Let's kind of the middle portion there. Let's kind of the middle portion there. Let's go back to the render view. And right go back to the render view. And right go back to the render view. And right here where it says number three, we're here where it says number three, we're here where it says number three, we're just going to click that. just going to click that. just going to click that. And let's go ahead and go from uklitian And let's go ahead and go from uklitian And let's go ahead and go from uklitian to chbbyev. So now we have these to chbbyev. So now we have these to chbbyev. So now we have these squares, but let's flip that squares, but let's flip that squares, but let's flip that so that we have this this uh grid here. So I'm going to this this uh grid here. So I'm going to this this uh grid here. So I'm going to make it a little bit bigger. I'm going make it a little bit bigger. I'm going make it a little bit bigger. I'm going to go from linear to constant so that we to go from linear to constant so that we to go from linear to constant so that we can have the thinnest lines we can get. can have the thinnest lines we can get. can have the thinnest lines we can get. So something like So something like So something like that. And then I'm going to bring that that. And then I'm going to bring that that. And then I'm going to bring that strength down. I don't want it glowing. strength down. I don't want it glowing. strength down. I don't want it glowing. Now notice we don't see the dots Now notice we don't see the dots Now notice we don't see the dots underneath. So we just need to plug this underneath. So we just need to plug this underneath. So we just need to plug this guy into the alpha. guy into the alpha. guy into the alpha. And then right here in the shader, we're And then right here in the shader, we're And then right here in the shader, we're going to go here from uh dithered to going to go here from uh dithered to going to go here from uh dithered to blended. And then now if I make these a blended. And then now if I make these a blended. And then now if I make these a little bit thicker, you can see you can little bit thicker, you can see you can little bit thicker, you can see you can see that parallax effect um working. So see that parallax effect um working. So see that parallax effect um working. So we're just going to bring this down to we're just going to bring this down to we're just going to bring this down to be really thin. be really thin. be really thin. And then maybe a little bit brighter. And then maybe a little bit brighter. And then maybe a little bit brighter. And then I do want this grid to be And then I do want this grid to be And then I do want this grid to be bigger. Maybe a scale of one. bigger. Maybe a scale of one. bigger. Maybe a scale of one. and then make this grid and then make this grid and then make this grid as thin as I can. There's there seems to as thin as I can. There's there seems to as thin as I can. There's there seems to be a limit to how thin the grid can be, be a limit to how thin the grid can be, be a limit to how thin the grid can be, but that's okay. So, now all I need to but that's okay. So, now all I need to but that's okay. So, now all I need to do is animate my camera and animate this do is animate my camera and animate this do is animate my camera and animate this texture moving to look really really texture moving to look really really texture moving to look really really cool. So, I'm going to pick a spot of cool. So, I'm going to pick a spot of cool. So, I'm going to pick a spot of the texture that I think is really the texture that I think is really the texture that I think is really really interesting. And then I'm going really interesting. And then I'm going really interesting. And then I'm going to go and get an empty an empty plane to go and get an empty an empty plane to go and get an empty an empty plane axis and place it right there so I can axis and place it right there so I can axis and place it right there so I can get my camera to look at that. So I'm get my camera to look at that. So I'm get my camera to look at that. So I'm going hit shift a camera control alt0 going hit shift a camera control alt0 going hit shift a camera control alt0 snap it to view and then in the snap it to view and then in the snap it to view and then in the constraints tab I'm going to get a constraints tab I'm going to get a constraints tab I'm going to get a track two. I'm going to click that track two. I'm going to click that track two. I'm going to click that empty. So now when I move my camera empty. So now when I move my camera empty. So now when I move my camera it's going to stare right at the part I it's going to stare right at the part I it's going to stare right at the part I want. But notice how this really cool want. But notice how this really cool want. But notice how this really cool parallax effect is taking place. That is parallax effect is taking place. That is parallax effect is taking place. That is the point of almost the entire point of the point of almost the entire point of the point of almost the entire point of this tutorial is to make something this tutorial is to make something this tutorial is to make something really cool with this parallax effect. really cool with this parallax effect. really cool with this parallax effect. So, let's just go ahead and I'm going to So, let's just go ahead and I'm going to So, let's just go ahead and I'm going to get myself maybe get myself maybe get myself maybe 400 frames. 400 frames. 400 frames. And this won't be a looping animation. And this won't be a looping animation. And this won't be a looping animation. The rare time this animation won't loop The rare time this animation won't loop The rare time this animation won't loop just because it would it's okay. We not just because it would it's okay. We not just because it would it's okay. We not everything needs to loop. So, I'm going everything needs to loop. So, I'm going everything needs to loop. So, I'm going to get a key frame. Just going to click. to get a key frame. Just going to click. to get a key frame. Just going to click. I'm going to stretch there. And then I'm going to stretch there. And then I'm going to stretch there. And then just go something like that. So, now we can look something like that. So, now we can look something like that. So, now we can look at this. Nice. It's really slow. The point is Nice. It's really slow. The point is Nice. It's really slow. The point is just to really highlight that parallax just to really highlight that parallax just to really highlight that parallax effect. I can even bring um the dot grid effect. I can even bring um the dot grid effect. I can even bring um the dot grid further down. This further down the dot further down. This further down the dot further down. This further down the dot grid further down just to really make grid further down just to really make grid further down just to really make that parallax effect a lot more that parallax effect a lot more that parallax effect a lot more dramatic. And then let's head back to dramatic. And then let's head back to dramatic. And then let's head back to the shading and animate the phase offset of our animation. of our animation. of our animation. So, we can go here, right over here, to So, we can go here, right over here, to So, we can go here, right over here, to the phase offset. the phase offset. the phase offset. And it looks like this is a workspace I And it looks like this is a workspace I And it looks like this is a workspace I haven't worked in yet. So, we're just haven't worked in yet. So, we're just haven't worked in yet. So, we're just going to go ahead and get a going to go ahead and get a going to go ahead and get a timeline. timeline. timeline. Let's go back here. I'm just going to Let's go back here. I'm just going to Let's go back here. I'm just going to hit the key frame on the phase offset hit the key frame on the phase offset hit the key frame on the phase offset and then I'm just going to move it and then I'm just going to move it and then I'm just going to move it around around around like that. like that. like that. Now, Now, Now, if I go back to layout, if I go back to layout, if I go back to layout, we can watch this animation take place. we can watch this animation take place. we can watch this animation take place. Are we real time? It's about 14 frames a Are we real time? It's about 14 frames a Are we real time? It's about 14 frames a second. So, this is a bit slower than it second. So, this is a bit slower than it second. So, this is a bit slower than it will be real time. But this is how our will be real time. But this is how our will be real time. But this is how our animation is going to look and it's animation is going to look and it's animation is going to look and it's going to be really, really cool. And you going to be really, really cool. And you going to be really, really cool. And you can have a lot of fun with it. Edit it, can have a lot of fun with it. Edit it, can have a lot of fun with it. Edit it, change it, do whatever you want to it, change it, do whatever you want to it, change it, do whatever you want to it, and it's just going to look awesome. and it's just going to look awesome. and it's just going to look awesome. These uh effects just are really really These uh effects just are really really These uh effects just are really really beautiful once you can play with them. beautiful once you can play with them. beautiful once you can play with them. And maybe you can even go back to to And maybe you can even go back to to And maybe you can even go back to to back to the shading and say maybe more back to the shading and say maybe more back to the shading and say maybe more on the detail. Yeah, I think that looks on the detail. Yeah, I think that looks on the detail. Yeah, I think that looks better. So now we can see a little bit better. So now we can see a little bit better. So now we can see a little bit more more more a little bit more interesting stuff here a little bit more interesting stuff here a little bit more interesting stuff here on the details. But that is how this on the details. But that is how this on the details. But that is how this animation is created. Let me show you animation is created. Let me show you animation is created. Let me show you how to export it and we'll be done. So how to export it and we'll be done. So how to export it and we'll be done. So go here to the camera icon. Actually, go here to the camera icon. Actually, go here to the camera icon. Actually, sorry the the printer icon. Select your sorry the the printer icon. Select your sorry the the printer icon. Select your resolution. If you want 4K, do 200. I resolution. If you want 4K, do 200. I resolution. If you want 4K, do 200. I highly recommend using a PNG sequence highly recommend using a PNG sequence highly recommend using a PNG sequence and just compiling those. Just go ahead and just compiling those. Just go ahead and just compiling those. Just go ahead and choose your folder. If you want a and choose your folder. If you want a and choose your folder. If you want a video instead of a PNG sequence, go to video instead of a PNG sequence, go to video instead of a PNG sequence, go to FFmpeg video encoding to MP4 and then uh FFmpeg video encoding to MP4 and then uh FFmpeg video encoding to MP4 and then uh medium quality to perceptually lossless, medium quality to perceptually lossless, medium quality to perceptually lossless, and you'll be done. So, there you go. and you'll be done. So, there you go. and you'll be done. So, there you go. That's how you create that. Again, if That's how you create that. Again, if That's how you create that.
