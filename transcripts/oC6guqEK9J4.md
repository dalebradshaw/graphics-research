How's it going, guys? So, in today's How's it going, guys? So, in today's How's it going, guys? So, in today's tutorial, we're going to be creating tutorial, we're going to be creating tutorial, we're going to be creating this logo animation. We're going to be this logo animation. We're going to be this logo animation. We're going to be using Geometry Nodes, and it's really, using Geometry Nodes, and it's really, using Geometry Nodes, and it's really, really simple to build. First, we're really simple to build. First, we're really simple to build. First, we're going to take the logo and distribute going to take the logo and distribute going to take the logo and distribute some points on it. Then, we're going to some points on it. Then, we're going to some points on it. Then, we're going to take that and make it a little bit more take that and make it a little bit more take that and make it a little bit more 3D and some ZSpace. Then, we can 3D and some ZSpace. Then, we can 3D and some ZSpace. Then, we can displace it using a noise texture. After displace it using a noise texture. After displace it using a noise texture. After that, we're going to distribute some that, we're going to distribute some that, we're going to distribute some spheres and some flat planes so that we spheres and some flat planes so that we spheres and some flat planes so that we can get a little bit of glitter and can get a little bit of glitter and can get a little bit of glitter and brightness and some color distribution brightness and some color distribution brightness and some color distribution in this animation. After that, it's just in this animation. After that, it's just in this animation. After that, it's just going to come down to lighting going to come down to lighting going to come down to lighting animation, and we're going to be done. animation, and we're going to be done. animation, and we're going to be done. So, it's really, really simple, but So, it's really, really simple, but So, it's really, really simple, but super effective and a really, really super effective and a really, really super effective and a really, really cool animation. If you'd like to get the cool animation. If you'd like to get the cool animation.

With that if you subscribe annually. With that if you subscribe annually. With that being said, let's get into this being said, let's get into this being said, let's get into this tutorial. All right, so to start out, go tutorial. All right, so to start out, go tutorial. All right, so to start out, go ahead and grab your logo. If you don't ahead and grab your logo. If you don't ahead and grab your logo. If you don't have a logo and you just want to follow have a logo and you just want to follow have a logo and you just want to follow along with this, I would say just take along with this, I would say just take along with this, I would say just take some text and pick a letter that you some text and pick a letter that you some text and pick a letter that you like, rightclick, and convert it to a like, rightclick, and convert it to a like, rightclick, and convert it to a mesh and you will be good to go to mesh and you will be good to go to mesh and you will be good to go to follow out the rest of this tutorial. follow out the rest of this tutorial. follow out the rest of this tutorial. Now, if you have a logo in vector Now, if you have a logo in vector Now, if you have a logo in vector format, what you'll do is go to file, format, what you'll do is go to file, format, what you'll do is go to file, import, and select SVG. I'm going to go import, and select SVG. I'm going to go import, and select SVG. I'm going to go ahead and grab my logo in SVG format. ahead and grab my logo in SVG format. ahead and grab my logo in SVG format. And then I'm going to go ahead and scale And then I'm going to go ahead and scale And then I'm going to go ahead and scale it up because they import really small. it up because they import really small. it up because they import really small. At least mine does. And then I'm going At least mine does. And then I'm going At least mine does. And then I'm going to hit tab just to get that anchor point to hit tab just to get that anchor point to hit tab just to get that anchor point right there in the middle of my logo. right there in the middle of my logo. right there in the middle of my logo. I'm just using G to move it. And then I'm just using G to move it. And then I'm just using G to move it. And then very important just cuz it'll kind of very important just cuz it'll kind of very important just cuz it'll kind of throw off your whole system. Make sure throw off your whole system. Make sure throw off your whole system. Make sure you hit control A and apply the scale. you hit control A and apply the scale. you hit control A and apply the scale. That's going to make sure the points That's going to make sure the points That's going to make sure the points distribute um properly so that this distribute um properly so that this distribute um properly so that this thing doesn't look like it's tiny. All thing doesn't look like it's tiny. All thing doesn't look like it's tiny. All right, with that being said, let's go right, with that being said, let's go right, with that being said, let's go ahead and I'm going to open up a new ahead and I'm going to open up a new ahead and I'm going to open up a new window. and we are going to switch over window. and we are going to switch over window. and we are going to switch over this window up here to the geometry this window up here to the geometry this window up here to the geometry nodes editor and I'm going to click new. nodes editor and I'm going to click new. nodes editor and I'm going to click new. So, first thing we want to do is hit So, first thing we want to do is hit So, first thing we want to do is hit shift A and get a distribute points on shift A and get a distribute points on shift A and get a distribute points on faces node and then we can just bring faces node and then we can just bring faces node and then we can just bring out that density. But specifically out that density. But specifically out that density. But specifically instead of random, go ahead and use instead of random, go ahead and use instead of random, go ahead and use poison disc. What that's going to do is poison disc. What that's going to do is poison disc. What that's going to do is give you this distance minimum. I'm give you this distance minimum. I'm give you this distance minimum. I'm going to bring my density to say I don't going to bring my density to say I don't going to bring my density to say I don't know one 1,000. And then you see this know one 1,000. And then you see this know one 1,000. And then you see this distance minimum that is going to distance minimum that is going to distance minimum that is going to prevent them from intersecting. But I prevent them from intersecting. But I prevent them from intersecting. But I really just want it to be the smallest really just want it to be the smallest really just want it to be the smallest it can be. Maybe it can be. Maybe it can be. Maybe point 01 because these objects are going point 01 because these objects are going point 01 because these objects are going to be really really small. Just having to be really really small. Just having to be really really small. Just having the slightest bit of control over their the slightest bit of control over their the slightest bit of control over their collision will go a long way. So we'll collision will go a long way. So we'll collision will go a long way. So we'll take this density and now what I want to take this density and now what I want to take this density and now what I want to do is make it a little bit thicker this do is make it a little bit thicker this do is make it a little bit thicker this direction because that's going to just direction because that's going to just direction because that's going to just make it look better. So we'll get a set make it look better. So we'll get a set make it look better. So we'll get a set position node. We're going to get a combine XYZ node because I just want a combine XYZ node because I just want a combine XYZ node because I just want to move it on the Z. So that's going to to move it on the Z. So that's going to to move it on the Z. So that's going to allow us to have access to a Z socket allow us to have access to a Z socket allow us to have access to a Z socket and we're going to get a random value and we're going to get a random value and we're going to get a random value node and plug it right into the Z. And node and plug it right into the Z. And node and plug it right into the Z. And that's going to go ahead and that's going to go ahead and that's going to go ahead and essentially extrude it. So maybe if you essentially extrude it. So maybe if you essentially extrude it. So maybe if you don't want it all the way there, you can don't want it all the way there, you can don't want it all the way there, you can kind of keep it in the middle. But kind of keep it in the middle. But kind of keep it in the middle. But that's just about as thick as I'd like that's just about as thick as I'd like that's just about as thick as I'd like it to be. And so now I'm looking at my it to be. And so now I'm looking at my it to be. And so now I'm looking at my logo here. So, what we can do now is set logo here. So, what we can do now is set logo here. So, what we can do now is set up the noise texture that is going to up the noise texture that is going to up the noise texture that is going to actually be able to allow us to make all actually be able to allow us to make all actually be able to allow us to make all these particles fly out in this really, these particles fly out in this really, these particles fly out in this really, really interesting way. So, what I'm really interesting way. So, what I'm really interesting way. So, what I'm going to do is just duplicate this set going to do is just duplicate this set going to do is just duplicate this set position position position node, get a vector math node, and we're node, get a vector math node, and we're node, get a vector math node, and we're going to get a noise texture as our going to get a noise texture as our going to get a noise texture as our pretty much like our displacement. So, pretty much like our displacement. So, pretty much like our displacement. So, make sure that you use the color because make sure that you use the color because make sure that you use the color because if you use factor, it's only going to if you use factor, it's only going to if you use factor, it's only going to kind of move them what would look like kind of move them what would look like kind of move them what would look like two axes. It's combining the XYZ into two axes. It's combining the XYZ into two axes. It's combining the XYZ into sort of this random diagonal. The color sort of this random diagonal. The color sort of this random diagonal. The color socket gives you multiple colors, which socket gives you multiple colors, which socket gives you multiple colors, which gives you X, Y, and Z movement. So, gives you X, Y, and Z movement. So, gives you X, Y, and Z movement. So, we're going to click on normalize to we're going to click on normalize to we're going to click on normalize to keep everything in the middle and plug keep everything in the middle and plug keep everything in the middle and plug color into vector. And you're going to color into vector. And you're going to color into vector. And you're going to get this. Now, right now, it's at. We get this. Now, right now, it's at. We get this. Now, right now, it's at. We need to switch this over to multiply. need to switch this over to multiply. need to switch this over to multiply. What multiply in this case is going to What multiply in this case is going to What multiply in this case is going to serve as a strength value. So, if you serve as a strength value. So, if you serve as a strength value. So, if you just click and drag, it's going to just click and drag, it's going to just click and drag, it's going to adjust the adjust the adjust the strength of the noise texture. And strength of the noise texture. And strength of the noise texture. And that's what we're going to use to um that's what we're going to use to um that's what we're going to use to um that's this one we this is going to be that's this one we this is going to be that's this one we this is going to be one of our animated values. Now you'll one of our animated values. Now you'll one of our animated values. Now you'll notice these points look huge. And if notice these points look huge. And if notice these points look huge. And if you're not ready to start instancing you're not ready to start instancing you're not ready to start instancing objects in here and adding geometry, objects in here and adding geometry, objects in here and adding geometry, what we're going to do is get what we're going to do is get what we're going to do is get a set point radius node. And then you a set point radius node. And then you a set point radius node. And then you can sort of bring them down a little bit can sort of bring them down a little bit can sort of bring them down a little bit to get a better idea of okay, this is to get a better idea of okay, this is to get a better idea of okay, this is going to be how it's going to look at going to be how it's going to look at going to be how it's going to look at the end. So maybe we'll bring up that uh the end. So maybe we'll bring up that uh the end. So maybe we'll bring up that uh density max to maybe 5,000. And then you density max to maybe 5,000. And then you density max to maybe 5,000. And then you can go go back and play with that noise can go go back and play with that noise can go go back and play with that noise texture. So what I want to do is switch texture. So what I want to do is switch texture. So what I want to do is switch this noise texture over to 4D because this noise texture over to 4D because this noise texture over to 4D because this is also going to be another value this is also going to be another value this is also going to be another value that we're going to animate. And I'm that we're going to animate. And I'm that we're going to animate. And I'm going to bring my scale to one and my going to bring my scale to one and my going to bring my scale to one and my detail to maybe detail to maybe detail to maybe five. And you'll see we'll get a really five. And you'll see we'll get a really five. And you'll see we'll get a really really cool movement. And then the more really cool movement. And then the more really cool movement. And then the more you bring that scale up, the more you bring that scale up, the more you bring that scale up, the more interesting or really just more interesting or really just more interesting or really just more different it's going to look. If you different it's going to look. If you different it's going to look. If you like sort of a recognizable pattern, you like sort of a recognizable pattern, you like sort of a recognizable pattern, you can bring that keep that scale around can bring that keep that scale around can bring that keep that scale around the one, two, or three. Or if you want the one, two, or three. Or if you want the one, two, or three. Or if you want it to be very just all over the place, it to be very just all over the place, it to be very just all over the place, you can bring it to a larger value and you can bring it to a larger value and you can bring it to a larger value and then it kind of looks like a cluster of then it kind of looks like a cluster of then it kind of looks like a cluster of bugs or whatever coming in. But I tend bugs or whatever coming in. But I tend bugs or whatever coming in. But I tend to like it to look like kind of a to like it to look like kind of a to like it to look like kind of a discernable pattern uh to some degree. I discernable pattern uh to some degree. I discernable pattern uh to some degree. I really prefer that. All right. Now, what really prefer that. All right. Now, what really prefer that. All right. Now, what I want to do is instance some objects. I want to do is instance some objects. I want to do is instance some objects. So, what we need to do is get a separate So, what we need to do is get a separate So, what we need to do is get a separate geometry node because I want some of the geometry node because I want some of the geometry node because I want some of the objects to be spheres and other objects objects to be spheres and other objects objects to be spheres and other objects to be this flat uh these flat circles. to be this flat uh these flat circles. to be this flat uh these flat circles. So, make sure it stays at the default So, make sure it stays at the default So, make sure it stays at the default point. And what we're going to do is get point. And what we're going to do is get point. And what we're going to do is get a instance on points node and we're a instance on points node and we're a instance on points node and we're going to get a icosphere here and we'll going to get a icosphere here and we'll going to get a icosphere here and we'll plug mesh into instance. And then we'll plug mesh into instance. And then we'll plug mesh into instance. And then we'll bring that radius down. Uh but there's bring that radius down. Uh but there's bring that radius down. Uh but there's no actual separation happening right no actual separation happening right no actual separation happening right now. It's just instancing icospheres on now. It's just instancing icospheres on now. It's just instancing icospheres on all of the points. We need to get a all of the points. We need to get a all of the points. We need to get a random value node that is set to boolean random value node that is set to boolean random value node that is set to boolean so that when we throw it into the so that when we throw it into the so that when we throw it into the selection, you can actually separate. selection, you can actually separate. selection, you can actually separate. And so see how there's missing there's And so see how there's missing there's And so see how there's missing there's missing uh you know, we're deleting missing uh you know, we're deleting missing uh you know, we're deleting points in a sense. That's cuz we have an points in a sense. That's cuz we have an points in a sense. That's cuz we have an inverted socket. So all the spots where inverted socket. So all the spots where inverted socket. So all the spots where you're seeing objects going away, they you're seeing objects going away, they you're seeing objects going away, they are now those those spots are being are now those those spots are being are now those those spots are being occupied by the other the inverted. So, occupied by the other the inverted. So, occupied by the other the inverted. So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to what I'm going to do is I'm going to what I'm going to do is I'm going to duplicate this instance on points. Plug duplicate this instance on points. Plug duplicate this instance on points. Plug inverted into that. And we'll get a join inverted into that. And we'll get a join inverted into that. And we'll get a join geometry node and plug instances into geometry node and plug instances into geometry node and plug instances into geometry. And then we're going to get a geometry. And then we're going to get a geometry. And then we're going to get a mesh circle and plug mesh into instance. mesh circle and plug mesh into instance. mesh circle and plug mesh into instance. And they're going to be huge. First off, And they're going to be huge. First off, And they're going to be huge. First off, we need to switch this over to inggon. we need to switch this over to inggon. we need to switch this over to inggon. And then bring that radius in. I'm going And then bring that radius in. I'm going And then bring that radius in. I'm going to give them vertices of six and then to give them vertices of six and then to give them vertices of six and then bring that in again. And so now we have bring that in again. And so now we have bring that in again. And so now we have a random distribution of each. What I a random distribution of each. What I a random distribution of each. What I want is more uh spheres than I have want is more uh spheres than I have want is more uh spheres than I have essentially these these they're they're essentially these these they're they're essentially these these they're they're going to look like glitter in the going to look like glitter in the going to look like glitter in the render. So, we're just going to keep render. So, we're just going to keep render. So, we're just going to keep them at that. Right here in the them at that. Right here in the them at that. Right here in the icosphere, I'm going to give it a icosphere, I'm going to give it a icosphere, I'm going to give it a subdivision of one just to keep subdivision of one just to keep subdivision of one just to keep everything smooth. And we'll get everything smooth. And we'll get everything smooth. And we'll get a set shade smooth node. And then I'm a set shade smooth node. And then I'm a set shade smooth node. And then I'm going to going to going to get another random value get another random value get another random value node and plug it into the scale of our node and plug it into the scale of our node and plug it into the scale of our uh spheres. Looks like it's randomizing. uh spheres. Looks like it's randomizing. uh spheres. Looks like it's randomizing. Yep. Okay. So, we have the We'll bring Yep. Okay. So, we have the We'll bring Yep. Okay. So, we have the We'll bring these down. Bring these up a little bit. these down. Bring these up a little bit. these down. Bring these up a little bit. I do want randomness in the scale of our I do want randomness in the scale of our I do want randomness in the scale of our spheres. So, something spheres. So, something spheres. So, something like that. And then we'll get another like that. And then we'll get another like that. And then we'll get another random value node. And we need to plug random value node. And we need to plug random value node. And we need to plug it into the rotation of the uh flat it into the rotation of the uh flat it into the rotation of the uh flat spheres. And then we'll just randomize spheres. And then we'll just randomize spheres. And then we'll just randomize it like that. And that is going to help it like that. And that is going to help it like that. And that is going to help when the light hits them, they will uh when the light hits them, they will uh when the light hits them, they will uh reflect really nicely. And then I do reflect really nicely. And then I do reflect really nicely. And then I do want them to be a little bit smaller. I want them to be a little bit smaller. I want them to be a little bit smaller. I want them to be kind of a subtle want them to be kind of a subtle want them to be kind of a subtle glitter. And then now that we're here, I glitter. And then now that we're here, I glitter. And then now that we're here, I still think the spheres are too big, but still think the spheres are too big, but still think the spheres are too big, but I'm going to go ahead and bring up the I'm going to go ahead and bring up the I'm going to go ahead and bring up the density density density to 20,000. And then I'm going to go back to 20,000. And then I'm going to go back to 20,000. And then I'm going to go back to my random value that's controlling to my random value that's controlling to my random value that's controlling the spheres. And just bring them the spheres. And just bring them the spheres. And just bring them smaller. Bring a couple bigger. And then smaller. Bring a couple bigger. And then smaller. Bring a couple bigger. And then I think that's good. That's good for I think that's good. That's good for I think that's good. That's good for now. we can go ahead and um add color now. we can go ahead and um add color now. we can go ahead and um add color into the scene. So, I'm going to go here into the scene. So, I'm going to go here into the scene. So, I'm going to go here to the material preview and we're going to the material preview and we're going to the material preview and we're going to get two materials here in geometry to get two materials here in geometry to get two materials here in geometry nodes. We're going to get a set material nodes. We're going to get a set material nodes. We're going to get a set material node and just duplicate it. So, this see node and just duplicate it. So, this see node and just duplicate it. So, this see where it says mesh circle. See that where it says mesh circle. See that where it says mesh circle. See that line? So, this bottom one here that is line? So, this bottom one here that is line? So, this bottom one here that is going to represent the metal or the going to represent the metal or the going to represent the metal or the metallic gold material that we're going metallic gold material that we're going metallic gold material that we're going to make and the other one is going to be to make and the other one is going to be to make and the other one is going to be that nice red. So, let's select this that nice red. So, let's select this that nice red. So, let's select this one. Make it kind of a interesting red. one. Make it kind of a interesting red. one. Make it kind of a interesting red. You can really obviously do any color You can really obviously do any color You can really obviously do any color you want. I'm gonna bring my roughness you want. I'm gonna bring my roughness you want. I'm gonna bring my roughness all the way up. And then I'm going to all the way up. And then I'm going to all the way up. And then I'm going to select it there. And then here on this select it there. And then here on this select it there. And then here on this material, we're going to make it material, we're going to make it material, we're going to make it metallic, pretty rough. And then a gold metallic, pretty rough. And then a gold metallic, pretty rough. And then a gold color. And then grab it there. And so color. And then grab it there. And so color. And then grab it there. And so now we now we now we have all of that. So now we can go into have all of that. So now we can go into have all of that. So now we can go into the lighting of this scene. So I'm just the lighting of this scene. So I'm just the lighting of this scene. So I'm just going to bring this going to bring this going to bring this uh I'm going to bring this geometry uh I'm going to bring this geometry uh I'm going to bring this geometry window over a little bit. window over a little bit. window over a little bit. And I'm going to go ahead and get a And I'm going to go ahead and get a And I'm going to go ahead and get a camera. So, shift A, get a camera. I'm camera. So, shift A, get a camera. I'm camera. So, shift A, get a camera. I'm going hit G and middle click. And then going hit G and middle click. And then going hit G and middle click. And then just position it. We're going to right just position it. We're going to right just position it. We're going to right over here in the camera settings. Give over here in the camera settings. Give over here in the camera settings. Give it 24 mm. G and middle click it 24 mm. G and middle click it 24 mm. G and middle click again. Something like that. And this again. Something like that. And this again. Something like that. And this right here, my immediate thought is, right here, my immediate thought is, right here, my immediate thought is, okay, the density needs to be higher on okay, the density needs to be higher on okay, the density needs to be higher on um the density needs to be higher on how um the density needs to be higher on how um the density needs to be higher on how many objects are in this scene. So, what many objects are in this scene. So, what many objects are in this scene. So, what I'm going to do is right here on the I'm going to do is right here on the I'm going to do is right here on the distance minimum, maybe 0.00 5 ought to give us a good amount of 0.00 5 ought to give us a good amount of 0.00 5 ought to give us a good amount of density. So, that looks really, really density. So, that looks really, really density. So, that looks really, really nice. So, now we can go ahead. I'm going nice. So, now we can go ahead. I'm going nice. So, now we can go ahead. I'm going to bring this window back and we can go to bring this window back and we can go to bring this window back and we can go into lighting. So, I'm going to go here into lighting. So, I'm going to go here into lighting. So, I'm going to go here to the cycles view. I am using cycles to the cycles view. I am using cycles to the cycles view. I am using cycles for this. I'm going to be dnoising my for this. I'm going to be dnoising my for this. I'm going to be dnoising my scene and I'm going to be using 300 on scene and I'm going to be using 300 on scene and I'm going to be using 300 on the samples. So, here in the world, the samples. So, here in the world, the samples. So, here in the world, we'll bring it down to black. we'll bring it down to black. we'll bring it down to black. I'm going to go ahead and get in a area I'm going to go ahead and get in a area I'm going to go ahead and get in a area light. Hit G and we're going to do a light. Hit G and we're going to do a light. Hit G and we're going to do a single lighting setup. This is something single lighting setup. This is something single lighting setup. This is something I do really really often and honestly is I do really really often and honestly is I do really really often and honestly is useful in so many cases. So, we're going useful in so many cases. So, we're going useful in so many cases. So, we're going to use a disc shape. Going to make it to use a disc shape. Going to make it to use a disc shape. Going to make it nice and big. And then we're going to go nice and big. And then we're going to go nice and big. And then we're going to go here to the cycles preview and maybe here to the cycles preview and maybe here to the cycles preview and maybe bring my power of bring my power of bring my power of like 2,00 here in the world. We'll go like 2,00 here in the world. We'll go like 2,00 here in the world. We'll go here to the volume and add a principled here to the volume and add a principled here to the volume and add a principled volume node. And then 01 is going to volume node. And then 01 is going to volume node. And then 01 is going to give us a nice volume. And then back to give us a nice volume. And then back to give us a nice volume. And then back to the camera settings, we can bring that the camera settings, we can bring that the camera settings, we can bring that spread down till we have a little bit of spread down till we have a little bit of spread down till we have a little bit of black here. And then I'm just going to black here. And then I'm just going to black here. And then I'm just going to go ahead and get a render go ahead and get a render go ahead and get a render region. So looks like 2,000 is too region. So looks like 2,000 is too region. So looks like 2,000 is too bright. Let's go with like 500 for now. bright. Let's go with like 500 for now. bright. Let's go with like 500 for now. So here we go. We have this scene and it So here we go. We have this scene and it So here we go. We have this scene and it looks really nice right now. I'm going looks really nice right now. I'm going looks really nice right now. I'm going to click on this and go to the red here. to click on this and go to the red here. to click on this and go to the red here. And I'm just going to go ahead and hover And I'm just going to go ahead and hover And I'm just going to go ahead and hover over it. Hit Ctrl + C. Go to the camera. over it. Hit Ctrl + C. Go to the camera. over it. Hit Ctrl + C. Go to the camera. I'm going to hit Ctrl +V. And then I'm I'm going to hit Ctrl +V. And then I'm I'm going to hit Ctrl +V. And then I'm just going to bring the saturation down just going to bring the saturation down just going to bring the saturation down so that we get this so that we get this so that we get this uniformity I think is the right word. uniformity I think is the right word. uniformity I think is the right word. Uniformity in the color. So now that Uniformity in the color. So now that Uniformity in the color. So now that we're here, what I want to do is at we're here, what I want to do is at we're here, what I want to do is at certain points in the scene, see how certain points in the scene, see how certain points in the scene, see how this piece of metal is really bright? this piece of metal is really bright? this piece of metal is really bright? It's really bright. It's reflecting. It's really bright. It's reflecting. It's really bright. It's reflecting. It's directly reflecting that light. It's directly reflecting that light. It's directly reflecting that light. It's going to be very very bright, but It's going to be very very bright, but It's going to be very very bright, but it's hard to communicate how bright that it's hard to communicate how bright that it's hard to communicate how bright that is if we don't have any compositing. So, is if we don't have any compositing. So, is if we don't have any compositing. So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to what I'm going to do is I'm going to what I'm going to do is I'm going to render out one frame and add some glare render out one frame and add some glare render out one frame and add some glare in the compositor. All right, so we have in the compositor. All right, so we have in the compositor. All right, so we have a frame rendered out. I'm going to go a frame rendered out. I'm going to go a frame rendered out. I'm going to go here to the compositing. I'm going to here to the compositing. I'm going to here to the compositing. I'm going to click use nodes. I'm going to go ahead click use nodes. I'm going to go ahead click use nodes. I'm going to go ahead and get a viewer node. And then I'm and get a viewer node. And then I'm and get a viewer node. And then I'm going to hit shift and uh rightclick. going to hit shift and uh rightclick. going to hit shift and uh rightclick. And there we're going to get a glare And there we're going to get a glare And there we're going to get a glare node. Plug it there. And then we're node. Plug it there. And then we're node. Plug it there. And then we're going to go here to going to go here to going to go here to uh to bloom. And then we're just going uh to bloom. And then we're just going uh to bloom. And then we're just going to go ahead and on the highlights I'm to go ahead and on the highlights I'm to go ahead and on the highlights I'm going to bring that threshold up just a going to bring that threshold up just a going to bring that threshold up just a little bit so that we can just kind of little bit so that we can just kind of little bit so that we can just kind of highlight those those points there. And highlight those those points there. And highlight those those points there. And then we can go back. I'm going to say then we can go back. I'm going to say then we can go back. I'm going to say click maybe and then you can hit this click maybe and then you can hit this click maybe and then you can hit this drop down and click always and you'll drop down and click always and you'll drop down and click always and you'll get to see those points. So now I'm get to see those points. So now I'm get to see those points. So now I'm going to go and animate this. So bring going to go and animate this. So bring going to go and animate this. So bring we're going to bring our window we're going to bring our window we're going to bring our window back and then in the in your preferences back and then in the in your preferences back and then in the in your preferences right here where it says linear. So go right here where it says linear. So go right here where it says linear. So go to the animation preferences. Go here. to the animation preferences. Go here. to the animation preferences. Go here. Switch it over to Switch it over to Switch it over to bezier. And we're going to animate this. bezier. And we're going to animate this. bezier. And we're going to animate this. So go to your vector math node. I'm So go to your vector math node. I'm So go to your vector math node. I'm going to go ahead and bring it out to going to go ahead and bring it out to going to go ahead and bring it out to something like that. I'm going to hit I. something like that. I'm going to hit I. something like that. I'm going to hit I. Go to frame Go to frame Go to frame 200. And then type in zero and hit I 200. And then type in zero and hit I 200. And then type in zero and hit I again. So this is the animation we have again. So this is the animation we have again. So this is the animation we have so far. We'll just view it one more so far. We'll just view it one more so far. We'll just view it one more time. Now, there's another piece of this time. Now, there's another piece of this time. Now, there's another piece of this animation that uh we can add some animation that uh we can add some animation that uh we can add some movement into it to make it look a movement into it to make it look a movement into it to make it look a little bit more alive and more organic. little bit more alive and more organic. little bit more alive and more organic. And that is going to be this W value. And that is going to be this W value. And that is going to be this W value. But it's really really sensitive. So, But it's really really sensitive. So, But it's really really sensitive. So, make sure we just do a little bit. So, make sure we just do a little bit. So, make sure we just do a little bit. So, I'm going to hit I'm going to go back to I'm going to hit I'm going to go back to I'm going to hit I'm going to go back to my preferences and switch this back to my preferences and switch this back to my preferences and switch this back to linear. I'm going to hit I on the W, go linear. I'm going to hit I on the W, go linear. I'm going to hit I on the W, go to 200, and I'm just going to move it a to 200, and I'm just going to move it a to 200, and I'm just going to move it a tad bit to like 03 maybe. tad bit to like 03 maybe. tad bit to like 03 maybe. And that is just going to randomly move And that is just going to randomly move And that is just going to randomly move these objects around. Even 03 is too these objects around. Even 03 is too these objects around. Even 03 is too much. Maybe 01. No, that was needs to be 0.1, not 01. No, that was needs to be 0.1, not 01. No, that was needs to be 0.1, not 01. 0.1. There we go. There we go. So, 01. 0.1. There we go. There we go. So, 01. 0.1. There we go. There we go. So, now they're just moving around at a more now they're just moving around at a more now they're just moving around at a more reasonable speed. Nice. All right. So now I just speed. Nice. All right. So now I just speed. Nice. All right. So now I just want to want to want to view the view the view the compositing. See these little glare compositing. See these little glare compositing. See these little glare moments. So now we have these little moments. So now we have these little moments. So now we have these little really nice little highlight moments really nice little highlight moments really nice little highlight moments here in the scene. That's just going to here in the scene. That's just going to here in the scene. That's just going to make it look a little bit more make it look a little bit more make it look a little bit more beautiful. And then maybe even see the beautiful. And then maybe even see the beautiful. And then maybe even see the random value that's connected to the random value that's connected to the random value that's connected to the separated geometry. Just bring that separated geometry. Just bring that separated geometry. Just bring that back. Maybe a few more pieces of back. Maybe a few more pieces of back. Maybe a few more pieces of glitter. There we go. That's going to be glitter. There we go. That's going to be glitter. There we go. That's going to be awesome. Okay, we are done with this awesome. Okay, we are done with this awesome. Okay, we are done with this animation. So, I'm just going to close animation. So, I'm just going to close animation. So, I'm just going to close the geometry nodes window. We can double the geometry nodes window. We can double the geometry nodes window. We can double check this animation looks proper. That looks really good. So, for proper. That looks really good. So, for proper. That looks really good. So, for your render settings, I'm going to keep your render settings, I'm going to keep your render settings, I'm going to keep it at 250 frames. Actually, no, it at 250 frames. Actually, no, it at 250 frames. Actually, no, maybe 230. Just so after it after it maybe 230. Just so after it after it maybe 230. Just so after it after it animates, it has some time to sit. I'm animates, it has some time to sit. I'm animates, it has some time to sit. I'm going to keep it at 300 samples. Right going to keep it at 300 samples. Right going to keep it at 300 samples. Right here on the printer icon, I'm going to here on the printer icon, I'm going to here on the printer icon, I'm going to keep it at a PNG sequence. And then just keep it at a PNG sequence. And then just keep it at a PNG sequence. And then just pick your F folder where you want to pick your F folder where you want to pick your F folder where you want to throw all those PGs. I'm going to do throw all those PGs. I'm going to do throw all those PGs. I'm going to do 1080p. If you just want Blender to 1080p. If you just want Blender to 1080p. If you just want Blender to export a a video for you, you don't want export a a video for you, you don't want export a a video for you, you don't want to deal with PNG sequences, you can go to deal with PNG sequences, you can go to deal with PNG sequences, you can go ahead to FFmpeg video um encoding ahead to FFmpeg video um encoding ahead to FFmpeg video um encoding to MP4. And then you'll hit render to MP4. And then you'll hit render to MP4. And then you'll hit render render animation. And when you're done, render animation. And when you're done, render animation. And when you're done, you'll have a really, really cool you'll have a really, really cool you'll have a really, really cool animation. So, there you go. That's how animation. So, there you go. That's how animation. So, there you go. That's how you create a really cool logo particle you create a really cool logo particle you create a really cool logo particle animation. It's really simple. Again, if animation. It's really simple. Again, if animation. It's really simple.
