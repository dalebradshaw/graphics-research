## Summary
Recently there has been a lot of discourse about #geometrynodes and if you should learn it.

## Notes
Recently there has been a lot of discourse about #geometrynodes and if you should learn it. In this video i want to address this idea and answer three questions. Who is geometry nodes for, when should you start to learn it, and how should you learn it. ----------------------------- project files - https://www.patreon.com/posts/cheat-project-136445059?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&utm_source=copyLink&utm_campaign=postshare_creator&utm_content=join_link ----------------------------- Patreon - https://patreon.com/user?u=9011118&utm_medium=clipboard_copy&utm_source=copyLink&utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator&utm_content=join_link ----------------------------------------------- 🌐 Connect with me: - Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/ducky3d/ - Twitter: https://twitter.com/Ducky3d

## Transcript
Recently, Blender Guru said that he Recently, Blender Guru said that he Recently, Blender Guru said that he would not recommend beginners to learn would not recommend beginners to learn would not recommend beginners to learn geometry nodes. And I completely agree geometry nodes. And I completely agree geometry nodes. And I completely agree with that. But I want to go a little bit with that. But I want to go a little bit with that. But I want to go a little bit deeper into that specific point. So what deeper into that specific point. So what deeper into that specific point. So what I want to talk about is who is geometry I want to talk about is who is geometry I want to talk about is who is geometry nodes for? Who's going to use it more nodes for? Who's going to use it more nodes for? Who's going to use it more often? At what point in learning Blender often? At what point in learning Blender often? At what point in learning Blender should you probably start learning should you probably start learning should you probably start learning geometry nodes? And in my opinion, the geometry nodes? And in my opinion, the geometry nodes? And in my opinion, the best structured way to learn that tool. best structured way to learn that tool. best structured way to learn that tool. So who's geometry nodes for? It's for So who's geometry nodes for? It's for So who's geometry nodes for? It's for everybody kind of, but in varying everybody kind of, but in varying everybody kind of, but in varying degrees. So, this is a list of a lot of degrees. So, this is a list of a lot of degrees. So, this is a list of a lot of the major ways that Blender is used. the major ways that Blender is used. the major ways that Blender is used. Kind of most 3D applications, but Kind of most 3D applications, but Kind of most 3D applications, but Blender specifically, this is a ton of Blender specifically, this is a ton of Blender specifically, this is a ton of major uses of Blender. I ordered them major uses of Blender. I ordered them major uses of Blender. I ordered them just randomly. Now, I've reordered them just randomly. Now, I've reordered them just randomly. Now, I've reordered them in what my opinion is, who is going to in what my opinion is, who is going to in what my opinion is, who is going to use it more often at the top all the way use it more often at the top all the way use it more often at the top all the way to the bottom, kind of not using it much to the bottom, kind of not using it much to the bottom, kind of not using it much at all. I think environment artists are at all. I think environment artists are at all. I think environment artists are going to be using it the most. You could going to be using it the most. You could going to be using it the most. You could build assets that can have tons and tons build assets that can have tons and tons build assets that can have tons and tons of variation. And then you could take of variation. And then you could take of variation. And then you could take that asset and then scatter it in tons that asset and then scatter it in tons that asset and then scatter it in tons and tons of different variation. Right and tons of different variation. Right and tons of different variation. Right after that, guys like me, motion after that, guys like me, motion after that, guys like me, motion graphics artists, having the ability to graphics artists, having the ability to graphics artists, having the ability to iterate really quickly, build really iterate really quickly, build really iterate really quickly, build really interesting structures pretty fast and interesting structures pretty fast and interesting structures pretty fast and make them procedural so you can change make them procedural so you can change make them procedural so you can change them and having a really cool creative them and having a really cool creative them and having a really cool creative approach to modeling and building and approach to modeling and building and approach to modeling and building and animating is very very useful and animating is very very useful and animating is very very useful and procedural tends to lean toward having a procedural tends to lean toward having a procedural tends to lean toward having a lot of expressive control. Then you have lot of expressive control. Then you have lot of expressive control. Then you have visual effects artists, modelers, visual effects artists, modelers, visual effects artists, modelers, specifically prototyping because in the specifically prototyping because in the specifically prototyping because in the prototyping stage, the model doesn't prototyping stage, the model doesn't prototyping stage, the model doesn't have to be perfect, but it's to help you have to be perfect, but it's to help you have to be perfect, but it's to help you get really good ideas. So having a lot get really good ideas. So having a lot get really good ideas. So having a lot of seed values for different components of seed values for different components of seed values for different components of a model so we can figure out which of a model so we can figure out which of a model so we can figure out which direction this product is going to be is direction this product is going to be is direction this product is going to be is really really useful. And the last one I really really useful. And the last one I really really useful. And the last one I think is going to use it a lot is 3D think is going to use it a lot is 3D think is going to use it a lot is 3D printing. And then after that we have printing. And then after that we have printing. And then after that we have things like simulations, animation, things like simulations, animation, things like simulations, animation, motion tracking and compositing and motion tracking and compositing and motion tracking and compositing and texturing are going to be using it very texturing are going to be using it very texturing are going to be using it very little. I think a lot of the really little. I think a lot of the really little. I think a lot of the really basic intermediate uses of geometry basic intermediate uses of geometry basic intermediate uses of geometry nodes, you can do those things without nodes, you can do those things without nodes, you can do those things without geometry nodes and I would say like geometry nodes and I would say like geometry nodes and I would say like older or pregeeometry nodes um tools, older or pregeeometry nodes um tools, older or pregeeometry nodes um tools, which means you can get really which means you can get really which means you can get really proficient in Blender for a long time proficient in Blender for a long time proficient in Blender for a long time before you can really need to start before you can really need to start before you can really need to start learning geometry nodes. Which leads me learning geometry nodes. Which leads me learning geometry nodes. Which leads me to the next part. When should you start to the next part. When should you start to the next part. When should you start learning geometry nodes if you are learning geometry nodes if you are learning geometry nodes if you are someone who's probably going to benefit someone who's probably going to benefit someone who's probably going to benefit from it? My simple answer is whenever from it? My simple answer is whenever from it? My simple answer is whenever you feel comfortable in Blender and you feel comfortable in Blender and you feel comfortable in Blender and you're making cool things without you're making cool things without you're making cool things without geometry nodes. I'm a motion graphics geometry nodes. I'm a motion graphics geometry nodes. I'm a motion graphics artist and I made several hundred artist and I made several hundred artist and I made several hundred animations before Geometry Nodes was animations before Geometry Nodes was animations before Geometry Nodes was even launched. But I will say once it even launched. But I will say once it even launched. But I will say once it was launched and I started learning it was launched and I started learning it was launched and I started learning it and getting good at it, my animations and getting good at it, my animations and getting good at it, my animations got so much better, so much more got so much better, so much more got so much better, so much more complex, and my ability to make really complex, and my ability to make really complex, and my ability to make really professional animation got much better. professional animation got much better. professional animation got much better. So if you're talking about like a hiring So if you're talking about like a hiring So if you're talking about like a hiring standpoint, doing freelance, whatever, standpoint, doing freelance, whatever, standpoint, doing freelance, whatever, my work got way better because I used my work got way better because I used my work got way better because I used geometry nodes. So when should you start geometry nodes. So when should you start geometry nodes. So when should you start learning it? So you're just now using learning it? So you're just now using learning it? So you're just now using Blender and I recommend start learning Blender and I recommend start learning Blender and I recommend start learning all of the big pieces of the program. all of the big pieces of the program. all of the big pieces of the program. Things like the modifier system, Things like the modifier system, Things like the modifier system, particles and hair systems, particles and hair systems, particles and hair systems, polymodeling, weight paint, all of these polymodeling, weight paint, all of these polymodeling, weight paint, all of these interesting things that all together interesting things that all together interesting things that all together help you build whatever the things that help you build whatever the things that help you build whatever the things that you want to build in the program. Get you want to build in the program. Get you want to build in the program. Get pretty proficient at them. You don't pretty proficient at them. You don't pretty proficient at them. You don't have to be a pro. You don't even have to have to be a pro. You don't even have to have to be a pro. You don't even have to be like a really proficient amateur. be like a really proficient amateur. be like a really proficient amateur. Just understand them and get to a point Just understand them and get to a point Just understand them and get to a point where you're not relying on tutorials in where you're not relying on tutorials in where you're not relying on tutorials in order to make the things that you are order to make the things that you are order to make the things that you are coming up with in your head or wanting coming up with in your head or wanting coming up with in your head or wanting to see and do from your references. I'd to see and do from your references. I'd to see and do from your references. I'd say once you're at that point, I think say once you're at that point, I think say once you're at that point, I think you will have enough knowledge to you will have enough knowledge to you will have enough knowledge to comfortably step into using geometry comfortably step into using geometry comfortably step into using geometry nodes. Okay. So, if you are a beginner nodes. Okay. So, if you are a beginner nodes. Okay. So, if you are a beginner in geometry nodes, how would I recommend in geometry nodes, how would I recommend in geometry nodes, how would I recommend you structure how to learn this program? you structure how to learn this program? you structure how to learn this program? because it can be very very complicated. because it can be very very complicated. because it can be very very complicated. Now, like I said, getting really good at Now, like I said, getting really good at Now, like I said, getting really good at Blender and learning all of the bigger Blender and learning all of the bigger Blender and learning all of the bigger basic tools, I think, is really basic tools, I think, is really basic tools, I think, is really important before you start learning important before you start learning important before you start learning geometry nodes. Mostly because I like to geometry nodes. Mostly because I like to geometry nodes. Mostly because I like to look at the beginning portion of look at the beginning portion of look at the beginning portion of learning geometry nodes as a way to learning geometry nodes as a way to learning geometry nodes as a way to replace those tasks that we used to do replace those tasks that we used to do replace those tasks that we used to do outside of geometry nodes that sometimes outside of geometry nodes that sometimes outside of geometry nodes that sometimes aren't procedural. things like aren't procedural. things like aren't procedural. things like displacement, face selection, boolean, displacement, face selection, boolean, displacement, face selection, boolean, wireframe, all of those things can wireframe, all of those things can wireframe, all of those things can actually be done within the geometry actually be done within the geometry actually be done within the geometry nodes workspace, keeping them in that nodes workspace, keeping them in that nodes workspace, keeping them in that same workspace. And they're all same workspace. And they're all same workspace. And they're all procedural and way more powerful done procedural and way more powerful done procedural and way more powerful done within geometry nodes rather than within geometry nodes rather than within geometry nodes rather than outside using other tools. So with that outside using other tools. So with that outside using other tools. So with that idea, it's a great way to structure how idea, it's a great way to structure how idea, it's a great way to structure how you research your daily learning. you research your daily learning. you research your daily learning. There's two ways to kind of learn There's two ways to kind of learn There's two ways to kind of learn Blender. You're watching tutorials, Blender. You're watching tutorials, Blender. You're watching tutorials, courses, you know, video format of courses, you know, video format of courses, you know, video format of learning. You're watching someone show learning. You're watching someone show learning. You're watching someone show you how to make a thing. And in this you how to make a thing. And in this you how to make a thing. And in this case, you're watching geometry notes case, you're watching geometry notes case, you're watching geometry notes tutorials. The other way, which is just tutorials. The other way, which is just tutorials. The other way, which is just googling and researching things. So, googling and researching things. So, googling and researching things. So, since we have this structure of, okay, I since we have this structure of, okay, I since we have this structure of, okay, I want to make a wireframe or I want to do want to make a wireframe or I want to do want to make a wireframe or I want to do a displacement, you'll look up how to do a displacement, you'll look up how to do a displacement, you'll look up how to do displacement in geometry nodes and you displacement in geometry nodes and you displacement in geometry nodes and you will probably go on Reddit and you will will probably go on Reddit and you will will probably go on Reddit and you will find a screenshot of a node tree. I find a screenshot of a node tree. I find a screenshot of a node tree. I think as a beginner, there's absolutely think as a beginner, there's absolutely think as a beginner, there's absolutely nothing wrong with looking at a nothing wrong with looking at a nothing wrong with looking at a screenshot of a node tree and going, screenshot of a node tree and going, screenshot of a node tree and going, "Okay, let me just copy what they're "Okay, let me just copy what they're "Okay, let me just copy what they're doing and then see how that works." That doing and then see how that works." That doing and then see how that works." That is what almost everyone who's good at is what almost everyone who's good at is what almost everyone who's good at geometry nodes has done at a certain geometry nodes has done at a certain geometry nodes has done at a certain point. And even if you're doing it and point. And even if you're doing it and point. And even if you're doing it and you don't know why each node does what, you don't know why each node does what, you don't know why each node does what, still do it. I think it's very still do it. I think it's very still do it. I think it's very beneficial to just get repetition going beneficial to just get repetition going beneficial to just get repetition going and learning all these nodes and how and learning all these nodes and how and learning all these nodes and how they work together. Once you do that a they work together. Once you do that a they work together. Once you do that a bunch of times, you will start getting bunch of times, you will start getting bunch of times, you will start getting it along with watching courses and it along with watching courses and it along with watching courses and tutorials. So, with that idea of going, tutorials. So, with that idea of going, tutorials. So, with that idea of going, okay, well, I probably will be looking okay, well, I probably will be looking okay, well, I probably will be looking at a lot of screenshots of node trees at a lot of screenshots of node trees at a lot of screenshots of node trees that I don't understand, but I'm going that I don't understand, but I'm going that I don't understand, but I'm going to copy them and I'm going to learn how to copy them and I'm going to learn how to copy them and I'm going to learn how to use them. In this video, I want to to use them. In this video, I want to to use them. In this video, I want to provide a ton of those screenshots of provide a ton of those screenshots of provide a ton of those screenshots of those basic tasks like displacement and those basic tasks like displacement and those basic tasks like displacement and booleans and wireframes and all of that. booleans and wireframes and all of that. booleans and wireframes and all of that. So, so let's look at how a bunch of So, so let's look at how a bunch of So, so let's look at how a bunch of those tasks work and the project files I those tasks work and the project files I those tasks work and the project files I am going to give you guys for completely am going to give you guys for completely am going to give you guys for completely free on Patreon. You don't need a free on Patreon. You don't need a free on Patreon. You don't need a Patreon account to download them. That's Patreon account to download them. That's Patreon account to download them. That's just where it's going. You can click on just where it's going. You can click on just where it's going. You can click on it, download the project files, and open it, download the project files, and open it, download the project files, and open them up if you ever need sort of a cheat them up if you ever need sort of a cheat them up if you ever need sort of a cheat code or, you know, a cheat list of how code or, you know, a cheat list of how code or, you know, a cheat list of how to do certain things when you are to do certain things when you are to do certain things when you are starting to learn the program. So, let starting to learn the program. So, let starting to learn the program. So, let me show you how a lot of those basic me show you how a lot of those basic me show you how a lot of those basic tools are made. All right, let's start tools are made. All right, let's start tools are made. All right, let's start with something we all know, an array. with something we all know, an array. with something we all know, an array. These nodes make an array. There's These nodes make an array. There's These nodes make an array. There's actually a couple ways to do that in actually a couple ways to do that in actually a couple ways to do that in geometry nodes, but it starts with just geometry nodes, but it starts with just geometry nodes, but it starts with just a line that has five places to add an a line that has five places to add an a line that has five places to add an object. And then when we plug them all object. And then when we plug them all object. And then when we plug them all together, we get an array that allows together, we get an array that allows together, we get an array that allows you to have some customizability. So you to have some customizability. So you to have some customizability. So play around with all of these nodes and play around with all of these nodes and play around with all of these nodes and see what happens. And then obviously you see what happens. And then obviously you see what happens. And then obviously you can play with the object that we are can play with the object that we are can play with the object that we are arraying as well. So this is a group of arraying as well. So this is a group of arraying as well. So this is a group of random cubes that I have set up to show random cubes that I have set up to show random cubes that I have set up to show you how booleans work. Now if I mute the you how booleans work. Now if I mute the you how booleans work. Now if I mute the boolean, this is all of the boolean, this is all of the boolean, this is all of the intersection. We have all of these intersection. We have all of these intersection. We have all of these objects right here that are intersecting objects right here that are intersecting objects right here that are intersecting together. And if looking at the together. And if looking at the together. And if looking at the wireframe, we're going oh okay. So when wireframe, we're going oh okay. So when wireframe, we're going oh okay. So when you're in a situation geometry nodes you're in a situation geometry nodes you're in a situation geometry nodes where you have things intersecting and where you have things intersecting and where you have things intersecting and you want them to boolean very simple you want them to boolean very simple you want them to boolean very simple it's a mesh boolean node. It's going to it's a mesh boolean node. It's going to it's a mesh boolean node. It's going to boolean them. It works pretty quick. boolean them. It works pretty quick. boolean them. It works pretty quick. Depending on the amount of geometry in Depending on the amount of geometry in Depending on the amount of geometry in your scene and I will also recommend I your scene and I will also recommend I your scene and I will also recommend I will also recommend that booleans work will also recommend that booleans work will also recommend that booleans work better if the objects are at varying better if the objects are at varying better if the objects are at varying heights. If they're all the same height heights. If they're all the same height heights. If they're all the same height it's not really going to work quite as it's not really going to work quite as it's not really going to work quite as well. At least not in geometry nodes. well. At least not in geometry nodes. well. At least not in geometry nodes. But this is booleans. Very common thing But this is booleans. Very common thing But this is booleans. Very common thing to come across when you're building to come across when you're building to come across when you're building things. We need to displace. This is the things. We need to displace. This is the things. We need to displace. This is the set of weirdness to make displacement. set of weirdness to make displacement. set of weirdness to make displacement. You have this multiply node to show, You have this multiply node to show, You have this multiply node to show, hey, this is strength, which this is a hey, this is strength, which this is a hey, this is strength, which this is a perfect way to understand math. Multiply perfect way to understand math. Multiply perfect way to understand math. Multiply node if you're not familiar. Multiply node if you're not familiar. Multiply node if you're not familiar. Multiply just really says the strength of the just really says the strength of the just really says the strength of the effect either uh less or more of it. And effect either uh less or more of it. And effect either uh less or more of it. And you can apply this to different pieces you can apply this to different pieces you can apply this to different pieces of geometry and it will get you a noise of geometry and it will get you a noise of geometry and it will get you a noise texture displacing the object. Extruding texture displacing the object. Extruding texture displacing the object. Extruding is fun. And I also made it randomly is fun. And I also made it randomly is fun. And I also made it randomly extrude with a random value node. But of extrude with a random value node. But of extrude with a random value node. But of course, we have just a regular course, we have just a regular course, we have just a regular icosphere. And then if we go ahead and icosphere. And then if we go ahead and icosphere. And then if we go ahead and bring an extrude mesh node, it'll bring an extrude mesh node, it'll bring an extrude mesh node, it'll extrude it however we want. And then extrude it however we want. And then extrude it however we want. And then this fun little magic randomness node this fun little magic randomness node this fun little magic randomness node goes, hey, randomize it. And you can goes, hey, randomize it. And you can goes, hey, randomize it. And you can have a lot of fun with randomizing the have a lot of fun with randomizing the have a lot of fun with randomizing the extrusion of whatever faces you're extrusion of whatever faces you're extrusion of whatever faces you're dealing with in geometry nodes. Now, dealing with in geometry nodes. Now, dealing with in geometry nodes. Now, insetting faces is actually kind of insetting faces is actually kind of insetting faces is actually kind of weird and complicated. So, let's just do weird and complicated. So, let's just do weird and complicated. So, let's just do it right now. So, you have an icosphere it right now. So, you have an icosphere it right now. So, you have an icosphere and I want to insert those faces. Well, and I want to insert those faces. Well, and I want to insert those faces. Well, first we're going to use an extrude mesh first we're going to use an extrude mesh first we're going to use an extrude mesh node. Now, if we were to extrude it like node. Now, if we were to extrude it like node. Now, if we were to extrude it like we did a minute ago, it's going to do we did a minute ago, it's going to do we did a minute ago, it's going to do that. I'm actually going to bring the that. I'm actually going to bring the that. I'm actually going to bring the offset to zero. So, it looks like offset to zero. So, it looks like offset to zero. So, it looks like there's no extrusion, but there's there's no extrusion, but there's there's no extrusion, but there's actually a secondary face that we actually a secondary face that we actually a secondary face that we created that we can access with this created that we can access with this created that we can access with this thing right here. So, what we'll do is thing right here. So, what we'll do is thing right here. So, what we'll do is we'll get a scale elements node. And we'll get a scale elements node. And we'll get a scale elements node. And right now, it's just going to scale the right now, it's just going to scale the right now, it's just going to scale the entire object. I want it to only scale entire object. I want it to only scale entire object. I want it to only scale that new face, the one that extruded that new face, the one that extruded that new face, the one that extruded out. I just want to scale that. So, I'll out. I just want to scale that. So, I'll out. I just want to scale that. So, I'll plug that into the selection. And now plug that into the selection. And now plug that into the selection. And now you're seeing you're seeing you're seeing this insetting happening. You can see it this insetting happening. You can see it this insetting happening. You can see it right there. And if I what I want to do right there. And if I what I want to do right there. And if I what I want to do is delete that face that we inset. So, I is delete that face that we inset. So, I is delete that face that we inset. So, I can say only delete that secondary face can say only delete that secondary face can say only delete that secondary face that we made. So, plug that into the that we made. So, plug that into the that we made. So, plug that into the selection. And now we have some selection. And now we have some selection. And now we have some insetting happening. So, it's kind of insetting happening. So, it's kind of insetting happening. So, it's kind of weird, but geometry nodes can feel weird weird, but geometry nodes can feel weird weird, but geometry nodes can feel weird quite often. And this is a great example quite often. And this is a great example quite often. And this is a great example of just like things you just have to of just like things you just have to of just like things you just have to rewire the way you think about building rewire the way you think about building rewire the way you think about building things. Now, there's going to be a time things. Now, there's going to be a time things. Now, there's going to be a time when you're going to wish you had a when you're going to wish you had a when you're going to wish you had a texture coordinate system if you're texture coordinate system if you're texture coordinate system if you're familiar with shading. So, this system familiar with shading. So, this system familiar with shading. So, this system of nodes is what we just looked at in of nodes is what we just looked at in of nodes is what we just looked at in terms of how to displace. If you need terms of how to displace. If you need terms of how to displace. If you need some mapping, then you'll plug in vector some mapping, then you'll plug in vector some mapping, then you'll plug in vector math nodes. So, in order to get them to math nodes. So, in order to get them to math nodes. So, in order to get them to work, I'm going to go ahead and delete work, I'm going to go ahead and delete work, I'm going to go ahead and delete them and get an a. We'll get vector them and get an a. We'll get vector them and get an a. We'll get vector math. And I know I'm going to want one math. And I know I'm going to want one math. And I know I'm going to want one stretch and squash and scale up the stretch and squash and scale up the stretch and squash and scale up the texture. The other one I just want to be texture. The other one I just want to be texture. The other one I just want to be able to move it around like a position. able to move it around like a position. able to move it around like a position. So, we're going to get two vector math So, we're going to get two vector math So, we're going to get two vector math nodes, but it's not going to work nodes, but it's not going to work nodes, but it's not going to work because it needs position information. because it needs position information. because it needs position information. Very easy. We need a position node. So, Very easy. We need a position node. So, Very easy. We need a position node. So, plug those into each other, right into plug those into each other, right into plug those into each other, right into the vector. So, this one I'm just going the vector. So, this one I'm just going the vector. So, this one I'm just going to have to move on the X and the Y that to have to move on the X and the Y that to have to move on the X and the Y that texture. And of course, is going up and texture. And of course, is going up and texture. And of course, is going up and down. So, you have just this guy moving down. So, you have just this guy moving down. So, you have just this guy moving around. You can animate. Now, I want around. You can animate. Now, I want around. You can animate. Now, I want this one set to multiply. What he's this one set to multiply. What he's this one set to multiply. What he's going to do is actually take the place going to do is actually take the place going to do is actually take the place of this multiply in effectively but also of this multiply in effectively but also of this multiply in effectively but also he is going to squash that texture or we he is going to squash that texture or we he is going to squash that texture or we can stretch out this texture using the can stretch out this texture using the can stretch out this texture using the multiply as well on the X Y and the Z multiply as well on the X Y and the Z multiply as well on the X Y and the Z giving you that texture coordinate giving you that texture coordinate giving you that texture coordinate system that you want. Now selecting system that you want. Now selecting system that you want. Now selecting individual or groups of faces is going individual or groups of faces is going individual or groups of faces is going to take a little bit of of of rewiring to take a little bit of of of rewiring to take a little bit of of of rewiring your brain how you think of it. In your brain how you think of it. In your brain how you think of it. In geometry nodes you can't just go into geometry nodes you can't just go into geometry nodes you can't just go into edit mode and go I want this. I'm gonna edit mode and go I want this. I'm gonna edit mode and go I want this. I'm gonna select this face. Select this face. You select this face. Select this face. You select this face. Select this face. You have to do it, of course, through nodes have to do it, of course, through nodes have to do it, of course, through nodes and accessing them. And it's learning. and accessing them. And it's learning. and accessing them. And it's learning. Every face has a number assigned to it. Every face has a number assigned to it. Every face has a number assigned to it. And that's called the index. So starts And that's called the index. So starts And that's called the index. So starts at 0 and 0 1 2 3 4 5 and goes all the at 0 and 0 1 2 3 4 5 and goes all the at 0 and 0 1 2 3 4 5 and goes all the way up depending on however many faces way up depending on however many faces way up depending on however many faces you want. If you want to select an you want. If you want to select an you want. If you want to select an individual one. So using this system of individual one. So using this system of individual one. So using this system of nodes, it'll allow you to select a face. nodes, it'll allow you to select a face. nodes, it'll allow you to select a face. In this case, I told it I want to select In this case, I told it I want to select In this case, I told it I want to select face number 24. So I'm saying using a face number 24. So I'm saying using a face number 24. So I'm saying using a math node I want to access indexes. He math node I want to access indexes. He math node I want to access indexes. He just is another way of using integers just is another way of using integers just is another way of using integers instead of that. We're selecting instead of that. We're selecting instead of that. We're selecting different faces based on their number. different faces based on their number. different faces based on their number. And then it has this fun little epsilon And then it has this fun little epsilon And then it has this fun little epsilon or espelon to get the ones around it or espelon to get the ones around it or espelon to get the ones around it too. So there's actually once you get too. So there's actually once you get too. So there's actually once you get into this there's a different lots of into this there's a different lots of into this there's a different lots of different ways to go about selecting different ways to go about selecting different ways to go about selecting faces. This is the sort of the beginning faces. This is the sort of the beginning faces. This is the sort of the beginning thought process of doing it. The very thought process of doing it. The very thought process of doing it. The very basic singular face way of doing it. and basic singular face way of doing it. and basic singular face way of doing it. and knowing, okay, faces have indexes, knowing, okay, faces have indexes, knowing, okay, faces have indexes, points have indexes, all of these points have indexes, all of these points have indexes, all of these indexes you'll have to be able to learn indexes you'll have to be able to learn indexes you'll have to be able to learn how to access. And the last one is how to access. And the last one is how to access. And the last one is something I've done over and over and something I've done over and over and something I've done over and over and over on the channel just because over on the channel just because over on the channel just because wireframes are really used quite often wireframes are really used quite often wireframes are really used quite often in motion graphics. It's just this fun in motion graphics. It's just this fun in motion graphics. It's just this fun little string of nodes. If we go ahead little string of nodes. If we go ahead little string of nodes. If we go ahead and delete them all, we can look at how and delete them all, we can look at how and delete them all, we can look at how it works. So, you just have an icosphere it works. So, you just have an icosphere it works. So, you just have an icosphere here, and then I'm going to convert it here, and then I'm going to convert it here, and then I'm going to convert it to curves like that. Now we need to to curves like that. Now we need to to curves like that. Now we need to convert it back to a mesh and then use a convert it back to a mesh and then use a convert it back to a mesh and then use a curved circle to say how wide that tube curved circle to say how wide that tube curved circle to say how wide that tube is going to be. Now we have a wireframe. is going to be. Now we have a wireframe. is going to be. Now we have a wireframe. That is all a bunch of little systems That is all a bunch of little systems That is all a bunch of little systems that as a beginner you're probably going that as a beginner you're probably going that as a beginner you're probably going to want to know how to do in order to to want to know how to do in order to to want to know how to do in order to build things that you want to build. So build things that you want to build. So build things that you want to build. So you can always refer back to these you can always refer back to these you can always refer back to these project files that are on the Patreon. project files that are on the Patreon. project files that are on the Patreon. Download them, open them up, or just Download them, open them up, or just Download them, open them up, or just simply Google them. These are not simply Google them. These are not simply Google them. These are not difficult processes to find on the difficult processes to find on the difficult processes to find on the internet. So there you go. Hopefully internet. So there you go. Hopefully internet. So there you go. Hopefully this answers the question for you. this answers the question for you. this answers the question for you. Should I learn it? when should I learn Should I learn it? when should I learn Should I learn it? when should I learn it if it's for me? Whatever those it if it's for me? Whatever those it if it's for me? Whatever those questions might be. I hope this video questions might be. I hope this video questions might be. I hope this video was beneficial for learning that. Again, was beneficial for learning that. Again, was beneficial for learning that. Again, you can get that whole collection of you can get that whole collection of you can get that whole collection of things on Patreon completely for free if things on Patreon completely for free if things on Patreon completely for free if you want. And if you want to sign up, I you want. And if you want to sign up, I you want. And if you want to sign up, I have a lot of really, really cool have a lot of really, really cool have a lot of really, really cool exclusive content on the Patreon if you exclusive content on the Patreon if you exclusive content on the Patreon if you want to check it out. So with that being want to check it out. So with that being want to check it out. So with that being said, thank you guys for watching and I said, thank you guys for watching and I said, thank you guys for watching and I will see you in the next
