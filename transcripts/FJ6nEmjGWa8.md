## Summary
Visual clutter can be your worst enemy when making 3D art.

## Notes
Visual clutter can be your worst enemy when making 3D art. But clutter dosnt always have to mean something bad. Sometimes it can just be a bunch of very cool details that need to be organized in a thoughtfulway. In this video I will show you a system of visual hierarchy to help you organize all yiur details in a beautiful way! ----------------------------- Patreon - https://patreon.com/user?u=9011118&utm_medium=clipboard_copy&utm_source=copyLink&utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator&utm_content=join_link ----------------------------------------------- 🌐 Connect with me: - Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/ducky3d/ - Twitter: https://twitter.com/Ducky3d

Clutter can be your absolute worst Clutter can be your absolute worst Clutter can be your absolute worst nightmare when it comes to making really nightmare when it comes to making really nightmare when it comes to making really good-looking renders. Clutter doesn't good-looking renders. Clutter doesn't good-looking renders. Clutter doesn't always have to mean something bad. Quite always have to mean something bad. Quite always have to mean something bad. Quite often, the clutter is a mix of really often, the clutter is a mix of really often, the clutter is a mix of really cool details that I want in my design. cool details that I want in my design. cool details that I want in my design. But sometimes you need to figure out how But sometimes you need to figure out how But sometimes you need to figure out how to make sense of all the clutter. You to make sense of all the clutter. You to make sense of all the clutter. You can do that by learning a system of can do that by learning a system of can do that by learning a system of visual hierarchy. Sometimes you're not visual hierarchy. Sometimes you're not visual hierarchy. Sometimes you're not putting the wrong details in your image. putting the wrong details in your image. putting the wrong details in your image. They're just not organized in the best They're just not organized in the best They're just not organized in the best way. and using a simple system of visual way. and using a simple system of visual way. and using a simple system of visual hierarchy that can take a really hierarchy that can take a really hierarchy that can take a really visually cluttered image and turn it visually cluttered image and turn it visually cluttered image and turn it into a beautiful balanced image. So into a beautiful balanced image. So into a beautiful balanced image. So today I want to show you a really cool today I want to show you a really cool today I want to show you a really cool system of visual hierarchy and I'll show system of visual hierarchy and I'll show system of visual hierarchy and I'll show you how I used it in a set of animations you how I used it in a set of animations you how I used it in a set of animations that I created this week. So let's start that I created this week. So let's start that I created this week. So let's start with what this visual hierarchy system with what this visual hierarchy system with what this visual hierarchy system is. You need to take all the details is. You need to take all the details is. You need to take all the details that you are going to put in your image that you are going to put in your image that you are going to put in your image and divide them up into primary, and divide them up into primary, and divide them up into primary, secondary, and tertiary details. Once secondary, and tertiary details. Once secondary, and tertiary details. Once you're able to figure that out, you can you're able to figure that out, you can you're able to figure that out, you can start to implement them and make really start to implement them and make really start to implement them and make really balanced images. Here's what I mean. balanced images. Here's what I mean. balanced images. Here's what I mean. Look at these two images. Both look Look at these two images. Both look Look at these two images. Both look really, really cool, but one of them really, really cool, but one of them really, really cool, but one of them just feels a little bit more balanced just feels a little bit more balanced just feels a little bit more balanced and a little bit more pleasing to look and a little bit more pleasing to look and a little bit more pleasing to look at. The one on the right has a lot of at. The one on the right has a lot of at. The one on the right has a lot of really cool details, but the focal point really cool details, but the focal point really cool details, but the focal point in the middle is just as visually in the middle is just as visually in the middle is just as visually cluttered as the space around it, making cluttered as the space around it, making cluttered as the space around it, making it feel really busy with no space to it feel really busy with no space to it feel really busy with no space to give your eyes a break. Now, the image give your eyes a break. Now, the image give your eyes a break. Now, the image on the right is just as detailed, but as on the right is just as detailed, but as on the right is just as detailed, but as you can see, the details and the shapes you can see, the details and the shapes you can see, the details and the shapes feel a little bit more intentional. You feel a little bit more intentional. You feel a little bit more intentional. You can see we have this one large shape in can see we have this one large shape in can see we have this one large shape in the middle, quite a few medium-sized the middle, quite a few medium-sized the middle, quite a few medium-sized shapes that kind of give your eyes a shapes that kind of give your eyes a shapes that kind of give your eyes a break from the busyiness, and then you break from the busyiness, and then you break from the busyiness, and then you have all those really, really small have all those really, really small have all those really, really small details scattered around the image as details scattered around the image as details scattered around the image as well. One thing to look at in this well. One thing to look at in this well. One thing to look at in this render and this render that I made is render and this render that I made is render and this render that I made is there is a good chunk of space dedicated there is a good chunk of space dedicated there is a good chunk of space dedicated to large objects that give your eyes a to large objects that give your eyes a to large objects that give your eyes a place to rest. Really busy, cluttered place to rest. Really busy, cluttered place to rest. Really busy, cluttered images can be really cool, but after a images can be really cool, but after a images can be really cool, but after a while, they have a strain on your eyes, while, they have a strain on your eyes, while, they have a strain on your eyes, and having a place for them to rest with and having a place for them to rest with and having a place for them to rest with larger and medium-sized objects can help larger and medium-sized objects can help larger and medium-sized objects can help you appreciate the smaller details. Now, you appreciate the smaller details. Now, you appreciate the smaller details. Now, how can you implement the system in your how can you implement the system in your how can you implement the system in your own renders? Let's look at a couple of own renders? Let's look at a couple of own renders? Let's look at a couple of these renders that I just taught on these renders that I just taught on these renders that I just taught on Patreon and show you how I implemented Patreon and show you how I implemented Patreon and show you how I implemented these ideas in these because there is a these ideas in these because there is a these ideas in these because there is a lot of details that I had to put in lot of details that I had to put in lot of details that I had to put in them. This render here is actually a them. This render here is actually a them. This render here is actually a good lesson in applying the system, but good lesson in applying the system, but good lesson in applying the system, but with really, really simple use cases. with really, really simple use cases. with really, really simple use cases. Sometimes to get a really well- balanced Sometimes to get a really well- balanced Sometimes to get a really well- balanced scene, you just need to start simple, scene, you just need to start simple, scene, you just need to start simple, just with some simple shapes. So, start just with some simple shapes. So, start just with some simple shapes. So, start with your main idea. In this case, it's with your main idea. In this case, it's with your main idea. In this case, it's going to be particles that take the going to be particles that take the going to be particles that take the shape of a system of hexagons. Once you shape of a system of hexagons. Once you shape of a system of hexagons. Once you have that idea, in this case, the have that idea, in this case, the have that idea, in this case, the hexagons established, you can look at hexagons established, you can look at hexagons established, you can look at your scene and try to feel out what is your scene and try to feel out what is your scene and try to feel out what is missing. Here I decided if I just missing. Here I decided if I just missing. Here I decided if I just duplicate the system, lower it down so duplicate the system, lower it down so duplicate the system, lower it down so that you have a lot more details below that you have a lot more details below that you have a lot more details below the main focal point and then so that the main focal point and then so that the main focal point and then so that they don't draw so much attention, I they don't draw so much attention, I they don't draw so much attention, I made the object smaller and the material made the object smaller and the material made the object smaller and the material a little bit darker. So we still can a little bit darker. So we still can a little bit darker. So we still can look at that main layer up top, but it look at that main layer up top, but it look at that main layer up top, but it does show a much more full scene that does show a much more full scene that does show a much more full scene that solidifies that hexagonal pattern even solidifies that hexagonal pattern even solidifies that hexagonal pattern even more, but in a more subtle way. And then more, but in a more subtle way. And then more, but in a more subtle way. And then I felt like it needed a little bit more I felt like it needed a little bit more I felt like it needed a little bit more fun in the lighting. So, I added some fun in the lighting. So, I added some fun in the lighting. So, I added some volume, added a light, and the scene volume, added a light, and the scene volume, added a light, and the scene really felt completed at that point. really felt completed at that point. really felt completed at that point. It's a very, very simple scene. So, It's a very, very simple scene. So, It's a very, very simple scene. So, applying visual hierarchy, large object, applying visual hierarchy, large object, applying visual hierarchy, large object, small object, sometimes doesn't need to small object, sometimes doesn't need to small object, sometimes doesn't need to be that complicated. Now, this render be that complicated. Now, this render be that complicated. Now, this render right here is a great example of having right here is a great example of having right here is a great example of having a lot of detail in it, but we're going a lot of detail in it, but we're going a lot of detail in it, but we're going to learn how to make sense of it and to learn how to make sense of it and to learn how to make sense of it and make a really cool image. So, like I make a really cool image. So, like I make a really cool image. So, like I said, in this image, I started with the said, in this image, I started with the said, in this image, I started with the big objects, the medium objects, and big objects, the medium objects, and big objects, the medium objects, and then all of the small details to finish then all of the small details to finish then all of the small details to finish it out. Now, it could still look cool if it out. Now, it could still look cool if it out. Now, it could still look cool if we just want to have large details and we just want to have large details and we just want to have large details and small details, or we can just do medium small details, or we can just do medium small details, or we can just do medium details and small details. Both don't details and small details. Both don't details and small details. Both don't entirely look that bad, but I personally entirely look that bad, but I personally entirely look that bad, but I personally think having a well- balanced system of think having a well- balanced system of think having a well- balanced system of all of those details makes this image all of those details makes this image all of those details makes this image look really cool. So, to make this, I look really cool. So, to make this, I look really cool. So, to make this, I started in geometry nodes and modeled started in geometry nodes and modeled started in geometry nodes and modeled the big blocks. Once I had those figured the big blocks. Once I had those figured the big blocks. Once I had those figured out, I was able to give them a little out, I was able to give them a little out, I was able to give them a little bit of wireframe detail. And then I bit of wireframe detail. And then I bit of wireframe detail. And then I immediately went into adding a solid immediately went into adding a solid immediately went into adding a solid reflective floor. After that, it made reflective floor. After that, it made reflective floor. After that, it made sense to add a little bit of roughness sense to add a little bit of roughness sense to add a little bit of roughness detail to the metallic surface that's detail to the metallic surface that's detail to the metallic surface that's able to let the light interact with it able to let the light interact with it able to let the light interact with it and really influence my decisions after and really influence my decisions after and really influence my decisions after that. But if I like the floor and the that. But if I like the floor and the that. But if I like the floor and the blocks, they still needed a lot more blocks, they still needed a lot more blocks, they still needed a lot more detail to make the scene feel large. So detail to make the scene feel large. So detail to make the scene feel large. So on all of the blocks, they got a subtle on all of the blocks, they got a subtle on all of the blocks, they got a subtle voronoi detail in them. And with a tree voronoi detail in them. And with a tree voronoi detail in them. And with a tree of wave textures and vorinoi, I was able of wave textures and vorinoi, I was able of wave textures and vorinoi, I was able to add tons of small detail in the color to add tons of small detail in the color to add tons of small detail in the color and the brightness of the floor, making and the brightness of the floor, making and the brightness of the floor, making this really, really cool looking scene. this really, really cool looking scene. this really, really cool looking scene. At this point, I had a good variety of At this point, I had a good variety of At this point, I had a good variety of big details and small details, but to big details and small details, but to big details and small details, but to balance it out, I was able to add some balance it out, I was able to add some balance it out, I was able to add some smaller blocks, and immediately it felt smaller blocks, and immediately it felt smaller blocks, and immediately it felt so much more balanced. Last thing I so much more balanced. Last thing I so much more balanced. Last thing I added was some small emission and bump added was some small emission and bump added was some small emission and bump details to the blocks, and it was details to the blocks, and it was details to the blocks, and it was totally done. One thing you'll start to totally done. One thing you'll start to totally done. One thing you'll start to learn as you get better at making images learn as you get better at making images learn as you get better at making images is being able to look at your scene and is being able to look at your scene and is being able to look at your scene and feel there's definitely something feel there's definitely something feel there's definitely something missing here. But learning how to go missing here. But learning how to go missing here. But learning how to go through that and answer that question through that and answer that question through that and answer that question will really help you be more efficient will really help you be more efficient will really help you be more efficient in making really beautiful images. Now, in making really beautiful images. Now, in making really beautiful images. Now, I want to lightening round a few of I want to lightening round a few of I want to lightening round a few of these renders and talk about these as these renders and talk about these as these renders and talk about these as well. The initial idea was to make this well. The initial idea was to make this well. The initial idea was to make this hologram style looking city in this hologram style looking city in this hologram style looking city in this animation, but at this point it just animation, but at this point it just animation, but at this point it just felt really cluttered. I didn't entirely felt really cluttered. I didn't entirely felt really cluttered. I didn't entirely know what to do and I landed on using a know what to do and I landed on using a know what to do and I landed on using a voronoid pattern to cut lots of gaps in voronoid pattern to cut lots of gaps in voronoid pattern to cut lots of gaps in the city and actually makes it look a the city and actually makes it look a the city and actually makes it look a little bit more interesting. Gives the little bit more interesting. Gives the little bit more interesting. Gives the scene some room to breathe. And I was scene some room to breathe. And I was scene some room to breathe. And I was able to add some smaller dot details and able to add some smaller dot details and able to add some smaller dot details and some other things in there to make the some other things in there to make the some other things in there to make the scene feel really nice and and broke up scene feel really nice and and broke up scene feel really nice and and broke up that scene that kind of looked like an that scene that kind of looked like an that scene that kind of looked like an aerial view of New York and just made it aerial view of New York and just made it aerial view of New York and just made it feel a little bit more balanced and feel a little bit more balanced and feel a little bit more balanced and breathable. The point of this scene was breathable. The point of this scene was breathable. The point of this scene was to teach how to use curves and make them to teach how to use curves and make them to teach how to use curves and make them kind of look a little bit more sci-fi kind of look a little bit more sci-fi kind of look a little bit more sci-fi and use voroi to manipulate them. But I and use voroi to manipulate them. But I and use voroi to manipulate them. But I wanted the scene to look really nice and wanted the scene to look really nice and wanted the scene to look really nice and balanced. So I started with the small balanced. So I started with the small balanced. So I started with the small curves and made a lot of them, broke curves and made a lot of them, broke curves and made a lot of them, broke them up a little bit and added some them up a little bit and added some them up a little bit and added some light to them. And then I added a few light to them. And then I added a few light to them. And then I added a few details on the floor with that square details on the floor with that square details on the floor with that square looking voronoi pattern. But to me there looking voronoi pattern. But to me there looking voronoi pattern. But to me there was something missing. And the answer to was something missing. And the answer to was something missing. And the answer to that was a very large set of curves as that was a very large set of curves as that was a very large set of curves as well on top of them to really balance well on top of them to really balance well on top of them to really balance out this scene and make it look really out this scene and make it look really out this scene and make it look really beautiful. And I absolutely love this. beautiful. And I absolutely love this. beautiful. And I absolutely love this. It's a great wallpaper. It's a great It's a great wallpaper. It's a great It's a great wallpaper. It's a great asset for a larger scale environment. asset for a larger scale environment. asset for a larger scale environment. It's really, really cool.
