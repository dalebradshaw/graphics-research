How's it going? So, you may have seen How's it going? So, you may have seen How's it going? So, you may have seen this effect uh somewhere on the this effect uh somewhere on the this effect uh somewhere on the internet. And if you don't know what internet. And if you don't know what internet. And if you don't know what it's called, it's called blob tracking. it's called, it's called blob tracking. it's called, it's called blob tracking. And typically, it's made in touch And typically, it's made in touch And typically, it's made in touch designer. But if you don't know how to designer. But if you don't know how to designer. But if you don't know how to use touch designer or don't want to pay use touch designer or don't want to pay use touch designer or don't want to pay for it, I'm going to show you how to get for it, I'm going to show you how to get for it, I'm going to show you how to get this effect completely free in Blender. this effect completely free in Blender. this effect completely free in Blender. There's four main steps to be able to There's four main steps to be able to There's four main steps to be able to achieve this look. First thing we're achieve this look. First thing we're achieve this look. First thing we're going to do is create some geometry going to do is create some geometry going to do is create some geometry that's going to have variation in that's going to have variation in that's going to have variation in geometry size, which is going to geometry size, which is going to geometry size, which is going to correlate to the effect in the shading. correlate to the effect in the shading. correlate to the effect in the shading. Next, we're going to use an attribute to Next, we're going to use an attribute to Next, we're going to use an attribute to turn the geometry into a texture that we turn the geometry into a texture that we turn the geometry into a texture that we can use in the shader editor and use can use in the shader editor and use can use in the shader editor and use that to kind of displace and glitch that to kind of displace and glitch that to kind of displace and glitch around the image that we're using. around the image that we're using. around the image that we're using. Because this effect is created with Because this effect is created with Because this effect is created with geometry, we can actually take geometry, geometry, we can actually take geometry, geometry, we can actually take geometry, convert it, and have them all connect convert it, and have them all connect convert it, and have them all connect with curves. Then all we have to do is with curves. Then all we have to do is with curves. Then all we have to do is take the one noise texture that is take the one noise texture that is take the one noise texture that is creating all of these movements, animate creating all of these movements, animate creating all of these movements, animate it, and you're completely done. So, it it, and you're completely done. So, it it, and you're completely done. So, it is just as simple as that. If you don't is just as simple as that. If you don't is just as simple as that. If you don't know about the videos on my channel, know about the videos on my channel, know about the videos on my channel, I've started a series of After Effects I've started a series of After Effects I've started a series of After Effects or kind of 2D style animations here on or kind of 2D style animations here on or kind of 2D style animations here on YouTube. So, you can check out several YouTube. So, you can check out several YouTube. So, you can check out several of those along with my Patreon where you of those along with my Patreon where you of those along with my Patreon where you can get a lot of extra content. Almost can get a lot of extra content. Almost can get a lot of extra content. Almost every month, I'm releasing a new batch every month, I'm releasing a new batch every month, I'm releasing a new batch of tutorials and I'm always on there and of tutorials and I'm always on there and of tutorials and I'm always on there and releasing new things. So, if you want to releasing new things. So, if you want to releasing new things. So, if you want to check it out, it's linked in the check it out, it's linked in the check it out, it's linked in the description and you can get a discount description and you can get a discount description and you can get a discount if you subscribe annually. Now, let's if you subscribe annually. Now, let's if you subscribe annually. Now, let's get into this tutorial. All right, so get into this tutorial. All right, so get into this tutorial. All right, so let's start with step number one. and let's start with step number one. and let's start with step number one. and we're going to go ahead and hit shift A we're going to go ahead and hit shift A we're going to go ahead and hit shift A and throw a plane or any piece of and throw a plane or any piece of and throw a plane or any piece of geometry into the main workspace. I'm geometry into the main workspace. I'm geometry into the main workspace. I'm going to be using Blender going to be using Blender going to be using Blender 4.4.1. We're just going to open up a new 4.4.1. We're just going to open up a new 4.4.1. We're just going to open up a new window. Switch this one over to the window. Switch this one over to the window. Switch this one over to the geometry nodes editor. I'm going to hit geometry nodes editor. I'm going to hit geometry nodes editor. I'm going to hit in and then we're going to get a new in and then we're going to get a new in and then we're going to get a new geometry nodes tree. Let's go ahead and geometry nodes tree. Let's go ahead and geometry nodes tree. Let's go ahead and delete the group input. And we're going delete the group input. And we're going delete the group input. And we're going to go ahead and get in to go ahead and get in to go ahead and get in a a a grid. Also, I'm going to hit the tilt grid. Also, I'm going to hit the tilt grid. Also, I'm going to hit the tilt key over here, go to the top, and we're key over here, go to the top, and we're key over here, go to the top, and we're going to go and get our camera. And then going to go and get our camera. And then going to go and get our camera. And then I'm just going to bring it out. I'm I'm just going to bring it out. I'm I'm just going to bring it out. I'm really doing this just visually to fit really doing this just visually to fit really doing this just visually to fit the geometry to a 16x9 space, which is the geometry to a 16x9 space, which is the geometry to a 16x9 space, which is what it's created by default. So I'm what it's created by default. So I'm what it's created by default. So I'm going to go ahead with the grid and just going to go ahead with the grid and just going to go ahead with the grid and just kind of eyeball it. This does not need kind of eyeball it. This does not need kind of eyeball it. This does not need to be exact. This is just sort of an to be exact. This is just sort of an to be exact. This is just sort of an artistic approach to this. So exact artistic approach to this. So exact artistic approach to this. So exact measurements really are not necessary. measurements really are not necessary. measurements really are not necessary. I'm going to go over here to the I'm going to go over here to the I'm going to go over here to the wireframe view. And right now we just wireframe view. And right now we just wireframe view. And right now we just have four faces. Right now we just have have four faces. Right now we just have have four faces. Right now we just have four faces here. So what I'm going to do four faces here. So what I'm going to do four faces here. So what I'm going to do is just get them to be get them to be is just get them to be get them to be is just get them to be get them to be relatively square. So, we're going to do relatively square. So, we're going to do relatively square. So, we're going to do six by four. And this is the first set. six by four. And this is the first set. six by four. And this is the first set. And just imagine that when the image is And just imagine that when the image is And just imagine that when the image is going to be spread across, these squares going to be spread across, these squares going to be spread across, these squares are going to be where those glitchy are going to be where those glitchy are going to be where those glitchy points go. So, depending on how small or points go. So, depending on how small or points go. So, depending on how small or large you want those images to be, large you want those images to be, large you want those images to be, that's going to correspond with the size that's going to correspond with the size that's going to correspond with the size of your faces. Now, what we're going to of your faces. Now, what we're going to of your faces. Now, what we're going to do is get a separate geometry node and do is get a separate geometry node and do is get a separate geometry node and switch this over to separate faces. switch this over to separate faces. switch this over to separate faces. We're going to get a join geometry node We're going to get a join geometry node We're going to get a join geometry node and then plug in the invert. And what and then plug in the invert. And what and then plug in the invert. And what we're going to do is plug a texture into we're going to do is plug a texture into we're going to do is plug a texture into this to tell it where and how much to this to tell it where and how much to this to tell it where and how much to separate this geometry. If that doesn't separate this geometry. If that doesn't separate this geometry. If that doesn't make any sense, um, just follow along make any sense, um, just follow along make any sense, um, just follow along and it will make sense. So, we're going and it will make sense. So, we're going and it will make sense. So, we're going to go ahead and get in a noise texture. to go ahead and get in a noise texture. to go ahead and get in a noise texture. We're going to plug the factor into the We're going to plug the factor into the We're going to plug the factor into the selection and nothing's going to happen selection and nothing's going to happen selection and nothing's going to happen just mainly because the noise texture is just mainly because the noise texture is just mainly because the noise texture is not dramatic enough. So, we're going to not dramatic enough. So, we're going to not dramatic enough. So, we're going to get in a color ramp to force that. If we get in a color ramp to force that. If we get in a color ramp to force that. If we switch this over to linear to constant switch this over to linear to constant switch this over to linear to constant and then just bring the white one in the and then just bring the white one in the and then just bring the white one in the middle and you can do 0.5 to make it middle and you can do 0.5 to make it middle and you can do 0.5 to make it perfectly in the middle. Now this is set perfectly in the middle. Now this is set perfectly in the middle. Now this is set up. You'll notice if we just get a up. You'll notice if we just get a up. You'll notice if we just get a subdivide mesh node and throw it right subdivide mesh node and throw it right subdivide mesh node and throw it right here. It's now going to take some of the here. It's now going to take some of the here. It's now going to take some of the separated geometry and subdivide it. So separated geometry and subdivide it. So separated geometry and subdivide it. So if you bring this over here, you can get if you bring this over here, you can get if you bring this over here, you can get more or less subdivision in the more or less subdivision in the more or less subdivision in the geometry. So now I'm going to take the geometry. So now I'm going to take the geometry. So now I'm going to take the portion of the geometry that is portion of the geometry that is portion of the geometry that is subdivided. This line right here. We're subdivided. This line right here. We're subdivided. This line right here. We're going to do another separate geometry. going to do another separate geometry. going to do another separate geometry. So really, we're only going to be So really, we're only going to be So really, we're only going to be dealing with the geometry that makes up dealing with the geometry that makes up dealing with the geometry that makes up the portions that are subdivided. And the portions that are subdivided. And the portions that are subdivided. And we're just going to plug it right there. we're just going to plug it right there. we're just going to plug it right there. And then we're going to do the same And then we're going to do the same And then we're going to do the same thing. Plug the noise texture, the color thing. Plug the noise texture, the color thing. Plug the noise texture, the color ramp, just plug those right into the ramp, just plug those right into the ramp, just plug those right into the selection. Plug the inverted into join selection. Plug the inverted into join selection. Plug the inverted into join geometry. And then plug a subdivision or geometry. And then plug a subdivision or geometry. And then plug a subdivision or subdivide mesh node there. And now we're subdivide mesh node there. And now we're subdivide mesh node there. And now we're going to going to going to have this interesting set. So if you have this interesting set. So if you have this interesting set. So if you switch this noise texture to 4D, you can switch this noise texture to 4D, you can switch this noise texture to 4D, you can actually animate how this looks. I'm actually animate how this looks. I'm actually animate how this looks. I'm going to bring the detail to zero just going to bring the detail to zero just going to bring the detail to zero just so it's a cleaner look. And now you can so it's a cleaner look. And now you can so it's a cleaner look. And now you can animate this subdivision look. I forget animate this subdivision look. I forget animate this subdivision look. I forget the specific way to describe this style, the specific way to describe this style, the specific way to describe this style, but that's how you achieve it. You but that's how you achieve it. You but that's how you achieve it. You essentially do two sets of separation or essentially do two sets of separation or essentially do two sets of separation or as many sets of separation as you want as many sets of separation as you want as many sets of separation as you want to get a really really interesting set. to get a really really interesting set. to get a really really interesting set. Now that we have this, the point of Now that we have this, the point of Now that we have this, the point of creating this in geometry is to be able creating this in geometry is to be able creating this in geometry is to be able to convert it into a texture, but to be to convert it into a texture, but to be to convert it into a texture, but to be able to go back and actually use the able to go back and actually use the able to go back and actually use the geometry that we are turning into a geometry that we are turning into a geometry that we are turning into a texture. So it all is created from the texture. So it all is created from the texture. So it all is created from the same set of data. So what we can do now same set of data. So what we can do now same set of data. So what we can do now is get a store named attribute node. I'm is get a store named attribute node. I'm is get a store named attribute node. I'm just going to give it any name I want. just going to give it any name I want. just going to give it any name I want. I'm going to do R just to represent that I'm going to do R just to represent that I'm going to do R just to represent that it's random. And then we're going to it's random. And then we're going to it's random. And then we're going to plug the color ramp. We're going to plug plug the color ramp. We're going to plug plug the color ramp. We're going to plug the noise texture straight into the the noise texture straight into the the noise texture straight into the value socket. And then we're going to value socket. And then we're going to value socket. And then we're going to tell it make we're going to tell it to tell it make we're going to tell it to tell it make we're going to tell it to recognize the faces. So now we're able recognize the faces. So now we're able recognize the faces. So now we're able to throw this information into the to throw this information into the to throw this information into the shading and look at it like a texture. shading and look at it like a texture. shading and look at it like a texture. So, what we'll do is get a set material So, what we'll do is get a set material So, what we'll do is get a set material node. Go right over here and just create node. Go right over here and just create node. Go right over here and just create a material and grab it right there. And a material and grab it right there. And a material and grab it right there. And I'm going to switch over to the shading I'm going to switch over to the shading I'm going to switch over to the shading tab. So, I'm just going to go ahead and tab. So, I'm just going to go ahead and tab. So, I'm just going to go ahead and rearrange these windows really quickly. rearrange these windows really quickly. rearrange these windows really quickly. I should just save these, but I just I I should just save these, but I just I I should just save these, but I just I just never get around to it. Um, and just never get around to it. Um, and just never get around to it. Um, and we're going to go here to the shader we're going to go here to the shader we're going to go here to the shader editor. Now, what we want to do is go editor. Now, what we want to do is go editor. Now, what we want to do is go ahead and call that attribute that we ahead and call that attribute that we ahead and call that attribute that we created with the store named attribute created with the store named attribute created with the store named attribute node. That's going to just be an node. That's going to just be an node. That's going to just be an attribute node. attribute node. attribute node. uh call the name which was R and plug uh call the name which was R and plug uh call the name which was R and plug factor into base color. And now we can factor into base color. And now we can factor into base color. And now we can see that texture. So if I were to go see that texture. So if I were to go see that texture. So if I were to go back to geometry nodes and go to the back to geometry nodes and go to the back to geometry nodes and go to the material preview window, I can play with material preview window, I can play with material preview window, I can play with the W. And you'll notice we have the W. And you'll notice we have the W. And you'll notice we have essentially a black and white texture essentially a black and white texture essentially a black and white texture that we can uh play around with. So I'm that we can uh play around with. So I'm that we can uh play around with. So I'm going to go back to the shading and going to go back to the shading and going to go back to the shading and let's go ahead and put our image into let's go ahead and put our image into let's go ahead and put our image into this scene. So go ahead and pick any this scene. So go ahead and pick any this scene. So go ahead and pick any image or video that you want. either image or video that you want. either image or video that you want. either images and videos, it will behave the images and videos, it will behave the images and videos, it will behave the same in terms of this glitching effect. same in terms of this glitching effect. same in terms of this glitching effect. So, what I'm going to do is if you have So, what I'm going to do is if you have So, what I'm going to do is if you have the node wrangler add-on enabled, just the node wrangler add-on enabled, just the node wrangler add-on enabled, just hit control T. It's going to give you a hit control T. It's going to give you a hit control T. It's going to give you a quick mapping setup. Use the object quick mapping setup. Use the object quick mapping setup. Use the object coordinate and I'm going to click open coordinate and I'm going to click open coordinate and I'm going to click open and grab my image. You can see a couple and grab my image. You can see a couple and grab my image. You can see a couple of these images that I was playing with. of these images that I was playing with. of these images that I was playing with. I found these landscape images to look I found these landscape images to look I found these landscape images to look really nice. And then I'm going to go really nice. And then I'm going to go really nice. And then I'm going to go get an empty and use that as uh the get an empty and use that as uh the get an empty and use that as uh the object that creates kind of my texture object that creates kind of my texture object that creates kind of my texture coordinate or my mapping. So, if you coordinate or my mapping. So, if you coordinate or my mapping. So, if you click the empty, then you can click the click the empty, then you can click the click the empty, then you can click the empty here in the viewport and scale it empty here in the viewport and scale it empty here in the viewport and scale it up. Now, the image is uh squished. It's up. Now, the image is uh squished. It's up. Now, the image is uh squished. It's kind of a square. So, you can take your kind of a square. So, you can take your kind of a square. So, you can take your empty and just sort of stretch it out. empty and just sort of stretch it out. empty and just sort of stretch it out. Kind of eyeball it. Um I should just Kind of eyeball it. Um I should just Kind of eyeball it. Um I should just look at the original image, but I'm just look at the original image, but I'm just look at the original image, but I'm just going to go by memory of how I remember going to go by memory of how I remember going to go by memory of how I remember it looking. And then one quick thing, go it looking. And then one quick thing, go it looking. And then one quick thing, go ahead and just delete the principled and ahead and just delete the principled and ahead and just delete the principled and plug the image straight into the plug the image straight into the plug the image straight into the surface. And that's going to bring it surface. And that's going to bring it surface. And that's going to bring it back to sort of the images original back to sort of the images original back to sort of the images original color and contrast and all that. So it's color and contrast and all that. So it's color and contrast and all that. So it's not a surface. So you can just go ahead not a surface. So you can just go ahead not a surface. So you can just go ahead and scale up the image to fit whatever and scale up the image to fit whatever and scale up the image to fit whatever square. I'm using a 16x9 square. I'm using a 16x9 square. I'm using a 16x9 um ratio here. And this is now our um ratio here. And this is now our um ratio here. And this is now our image. Now what we can do is right here image. Now what we can do is right here image. Now what we can do is right here on this line get a mix on this line get a mix on this line get a mix color. And now throw that texture or color. And now throw that texture or color. And now throw that texture or that geometry straight into there. And that geometry straight into there. And that geometry straight into there. And you're going to notice that glitch start you're going to notice that glitch start you're going to notice that glitch start to happen. So it's starting to move it to happen. So it's starting to move it to happen. So it's starting to move it around. It's combining your regular around. It's combining your regular around. It's combining your regular mapping with this new black and white mapping with this new black and white mapping with this new black and white value mapping. And it's going to kind of value mapping. And it's going to kind of value mapping. And it's going to kind of play with it a little bit. And so we can play with it a little bit. And so we can play with it a little bit. And so we can head back to geometry nodes. I'm going head back to geometry nodes. I'm going head back to geometry nodes. I'm going collapse this window here. Notice there collapse this window here. Notice there collapse this window here. Notice there is a line going straight into the store is a line going straight into the store is a line going straight into the store named attribute. So what we can do is named attribute. So what we can do is named attribute. So what we can do is get a color ramp to play with that a get a color ramp to play with that a get a color ramp to play with that a little bit. So, if you get a color ramp, little bit. So, if you get a color ramp, little bit. So, if you get a color ramp, switch it to switch it to switch it to constant, you'll be able to just get a constant, you'll be able to just get a constant, you'll be able to just get a couple, say something like like this. couple, say something like like this. couple, say something like like this. And then I'm going to go back to the And then I'm going to go back to the And then I'm going to go back to the empty and get that background image to empty and get that background image to empty and get that background image to be scaled properly. There we go. And be scaled properly. There we go. And be scaled properly. There we go. And then if you play with the W, we now have then if you play with the W, we now have then if you play with the W, we now have this this this image glitching around. And it's pretty image glitching around. And it's pretty image glitching around. And it's pretty cool. What I found looks really good is cool. What I found looks really good is cool. What I found looks really good is if you get a wave texture with a scale if you get a wave texture with a scale if you get a wave texture with a scale of of of 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, it makes the images feel a little bit it makes the images feel a little bit it makes the images feel a little bit better. We're going to do a scale of two better. We're going to do a scale of two better. We're going to do a scale of two on the noise texture. And it does I do on the noise texture. And it does I do on the noise texture. And it does I do appreciate the behavior a little bit appreciate the behavior a little bit appreciate the behavior a little bit more. So, I'm going to flip my color more. So, I'm going to flip my color more. So, I'm going to flip my color ramp actually. And I noticed when I flipped actually. And I noticed when I flipped actually. And I noticed when I flipped the color ramp, he used the combination the color ramp, he used the combination the color ramp, he used the combination with the wave. I really do enjoy that with the wave. I really do enjoy that with the wave. I really do enjoy that movement quite a bit more than the movement quite a bit more than the movement quite a bit more than the original. Um, but really it's going to original. Um, but really it's going to original. Um, but really it's going to be up to just playing with it. You can be up to just playing with it. You can be up to just playing with it. You can just keep the noise texture, play with just keep the noise texture, play with just keep the noise texture, play with those values. Um, but this I really, those values. Um, but this I really, those values. Um, but this I really, really like. So, now that we have really like. So, now that we have really like. So, now that we have this working properly, we now need to this working properly, we now need to this working properly, we now need to create that effect where all of those create that effect where all of those create that effect where all of those little squares have this red line little squares have this red line little squares have this red line connecting to each other. connecting to each other. connecting to each other. So, we're going to go back to the So, we're going to go back to the So, we're going to go back to the wireframe view. And what I'm going to do wireframe view. And what I'm going to do wireframe view. And what I'm going to do is I'm just going to go ahead and sever is I'm just going to go ahead and sever is I'm just going to go ahead and sever the connection right there. And we're the connection right there. And we're the connection right there. And we're going to go ahead and get going to go ahead and get going to go ahead and get a delete geometry. And I'm going to plug a delete geometry. And I'm going to plug a delete geometry. And I'm going to plug the the color amp right here that plugs the the color amp right here that plugs the the color amp right here that plugs into the store named attribute. This into the store named attribute. This into the store named attribute. This color amp is the one that crunches in color amp is the one that crunches in color amp is the one that crunches in those images to just a couple of those those images to just a couple of those those images to just a couple of those cubes, a couple of those squares that cubes, a couple of those squares that cubes, a couple of those squares that glitch in and out. So I want to use that glitch in and out. So I want to use that glitch in and out. So I want to use that same specification to be plugged into same specification to be plugged into same specification to be plugged into the delete geometry. So we can actually the delete geometry. So we can actually the delete geometry. So we can actually delete that specific geometry. So what delete that specific geometry. So what delete that specific geometry. So what I'm going to do is plug this join I'm going to do is plug this join I'm going to do is plug this join geometry, the one that goes right before geometry, the one that goes right before geometry, the one that goes right before the store named attribute right after the store named attribute right after the store named attribute right after all of these nodes that created that all of these nodes that created that all of these nodes that created that variation geometry. Plug that into the variation geometry. Plug that into the variation geometry. Plug that into the geometry. Switch this over to face. geometry. Switch this over to face. geometry. Switch this over to face. We're going to plug the color ramp into We're going to plug the color ramp into We're going to plug the color ramp into that and then plug and then we're going that and then plug and then we're going that and then plug and then we're going to get to get to get a join geometry so that we can plug this a join geometry so that we can plug this a join geometry so that we can plug this stuff that all this this image stuff that all this this image stuff that all this this image information into it and this new information into it and this new information into it and this new information. So we'll just plug that information. So we'll just plug that information. So we'll just plug that there. Plug this there. Plug this there. Plug this here and you'll here and you'll here and you'll notice we'll play with the W. It's doing notice we'll play with the W. It's doing notice we'll play with the W. It's doing that. You'll notice it's doing that. that. You'll notice it's doing that. that. You'll notice it's doing that. What we can do is just invert it with a What we can do is just invert it with a What we can do is just invert it with a color ramp. color ramp. color ramp. So plug that there and then just flip So plug that there and then just flip So plug that there and then just flip the color ramp. So that's just inverting the color ramp. So that's just inverting the color ramp. So that's just inverting that texture so we don't have to change that texture so we don't have to change that texture so we don't have to change anything. And then now you have all of anything. And then now you have all of anything. And then now you have all of this geometry. What I want to do is this geometry. What I want to do is this geometry. What I want to do is convert all of these faces into uh convert all of these faces into uh convert all of these faces into uh points. So I'm just going to take these points. So I'm just going to take these points. So I'm just going to take these guys here, highlight them, and bring guys here, highlight them, and bring guys here, highlight them, and bring them over a little bit. What I want to them over a little bit. What I want to them over a little bit. What I want to do is to turn these faces into points. do is to turn these faces into points. do is to turn these faces into points. And so that's very easy. You can just go And so that's very easy. You can just go And so that's very easy. You can just go ahead and do a mesh to points and say ahead and do a mesh to points and say ahead and do a mesh to points and say use the faces. And so now again, if you use the faces. And so now again, if you use the faces. And so now again, if you play with that noise texture, we're just play with that noise texture, we're just play with that noise texture, we're just getting points. And if I were to plug getting points. And if I were to plug getting points. And if I were to plug this material set material into the this material set material into the this material set material into the join, you'll join, you'll join, you'll notice, see those points are on top of notice, see those points are on top of notice, see those points are on top of each image square. So this is sort this each image square. So this is sort this each image square. So this is sort this is just to confirm, hey, this is working is just to confirm, hey, this is working is just to confirm, hey, this is working properly. And once these points connect, properly. And once these points connect, properly. And once these points connect, this effect is going to work, right? So, this effect is going to work, right? So, this effect is going to work, right? So, I'm just going to go ahead and sever I'm just going to go ahead and sever I'm just going to go ahead and sever that and go back. What we need to do now that and go back. What we need to do now that and go back. What we need to do now is to create a really kind of weird is to create a really kind of weird is to create a really kind of weird setup of nodes to get every point here setup of nodes to get every point here setup of nodes to get every point here to connect. So, I'm just going to go to connect. So, I'm just going to go to connect. So, I'm just going to go ahead and play with my W till I have a ahead and play with my W till I have a ahead and play with my W till I have a few more points that we'll want to few more points that we'll want to few more points that we'll want to connect. So, right after the mesh to connect. So, right after the mesh to connect. So, right after the mesh to points node, let's go ahead and get a points node, let's go ahead and get a points node, let's go ahead and get a for each element for each element for each element node. And we're going to need two of node. And we're going to need two of node. And we're going to need two of them. So, let's go ahead. I'm g sever them. So, let's go ahead. I'm g sever them. So, let's go ahead. I'm g sever that points to geometry. And then this that points to geometry. And then this that points to geometry. And then this lower green. Plug him there. And then lower green. Plug him there. And then lower green. Plug him there. And then we're just going to get another for each we're just going to get another for each we're just going to get another for each element node. And we're going to plug element node. And we're going to plug element node. And we're going to plug this lower green into hem right there. this lower green into hem right there. this lower green into hem right there. And here's what we're going to do now. And here's what we're going to do now. And here's what we're going to do now. Let's go ahead and throw some data into Let's go ahead and throw some data into Let's go ahead and throw some data into it to get all of those points to connect it to get all of those points to connect it to get all of those points to connect each other with a curve. So, first we're each other with a curve. So, first we're each other with a curve. So, first we're going to need a position node. And going to need a position node. And going to need a position node. And because it's a for each element node, because it's a for each element node, because it's a for each element node, once we plug him into here, it's going once we plug him into here, it's going once we plug him into here, it's going to create a position some position data to create a position some position data to create a position some position data for each one of those points that we for each one of those points that we for each one of those points that we generated. Let's go ahead and get a generated. Let's go ahead and get a generated. Let's go ahead and get a curve line node. Curve line. And the curve line node. Curve line. And the curve line node. Curve line. And the this point we're going to get the this point we're going to get the this point we're going to get the position of each point into the start of position of each point into the start of position of each point into the start of the curve line. So one end of the curve, the curve line. So one end of the curve, the curve line. So one end of the curve, we're saying, hey, start there. Now, we we're saying, hey, start there. Now, we we're saying, hey, start there. Now, we need to get the other end of the curve need to get the other end of the curve need to get the other end of the curve to also connect to everything. So, I'm to also connect to everything. So, I'm to also connect to everything. So, I'm just going to go ahead and give myself a just going to go ahead and give myself a just going to go ahead and give myself a little bit more space. I'm highlighting little bit more space. I'm highlighting little bit more space. I'm highlighting and hitting G. Now, we're going to need and hitting G. Now, we're going to need and hitting G. Now, we're going to need to get a to get a to get a sample index node. We're going to get sample index node. We're going to get sample index node. We're going to get another position node. We're going to another position node. We're going to another position node. We're going to switch this over to a vector. Plug switch this over to a vector. Plug switch this over to a vector. Plug position into value. The mesh to points position into value. The mesh to points position into value. The mesh to points is going to go here, right here into the is going to go here, right here into the is going to go here, right here into the geometry. And then the element right geometry. And then the element right geometry. And then the element right here into the geometry. And then he is here into the geometry. And then he is here into the geometry. And then he is going to represent the end of the curve. going to represent the end of the curve. going to represent the end of the curve. And then we're just going to plug this And then we're just going to plug this And then we're just going to plug this curve line into geometry. And now all of curve line into geometry. And now all of curve line into geometry. And now all of them connect. So it's kind of a weird them connect. So it's kind of a weird them connect. So it's kind of a weird convoluted mess of nodes. If you convoluted mess of nodes. If you convoluted mess of nodes. If you recognize the setup, I actually did a recognize the setup, I actually did a recognize the setup, I actually did a tutorial on it earlier and it created tutorial on it earlier and it created tutorial on it earlier and it created this animation. So that very much goes this animation. So that very much goes this animation. So that very much goes to show same process, highly different to show same process, highly different to show same process, highly different result, similar idea. So you can really result, similar idea. So you can really result, similar idea. So you can really take really cool things like this and take really cool things like this and take really cool things like this and use them for other things. And that's use them for other things. And that's use them for other things. And that's where you can start to take these where you can start to take these where you can start to take these processes and go, "Oh, I recognize that processes and go, "Oh, I recognize that processes and go, "Oh, I recognize that all these things are connected. I all these things are connected. I all these things are connected. I recognize that node setup. I'm going to recognize that node setup. I'm going to recognize that node setup. I'm going to use it in this completely different way. use it in this completely different way. use it in this completely different way. And that's how you can really creatively And that's how you can really creatively And that's how you can really creatively use setups like this that are very use setups like this that are very use setups like this that are very technical, but you can be very artistic technical, but you can be very artistic technical, but you can be very artistic with their use case. Now that we have with their use case. Now that we have with their use case. Now that we have all these connected, there's some stuff all these connected, there's some stuff all these connected, there's some stuff going on that may not be entirely going on that may not be entirely going on that may not be entirely visual. But visual. But visual. But essentially, you may see one curve. essentially, you may see one curve. essentially, you may see one curve. There's really, I believe, three. One There's really, I believe, three. One There's really, I believe, three. One going there, one going back, one going going there, one going back, one going going there, one going back, one going back. So, you have some duplicates back. So, you have some duplicates back. So, you have some duplicates that's going to create extra geometry. that's going to create extra geometry. that's going to create extra geometry. So, I want to just go ahead and delete So, I want to just go ahead and delete So, I want to just go ahead and delete the curves that are overlapping because the curves that are overlapping because the curves that are overlapping because you can't even see it. And once we turn you can't even see it. And once we turn you can't even see it. And once we turn it into geometry, it's going to be three it into geometry, it's going to be three it into geometry, it's going to be three times the geometry we need. So what times the geometry we need. So what times the geometry we need. So what we'll do is convert it to a mesh. We'll do a curve to mesh. And this mesh. We'll do a curve to mesh. And this mesh. We'll do a curve to mesh. And this isn't to create that wireframe effect isn't to create that wireframe effect isn't to create that wireframe effect that I'm normally doing with this node. that I'm normally doing with this node. that I'm normally doing with this node. It's simply to turn it into a It's simply to turn it into a It's simply to turn it into a mesh and allow us to use this merge by mesh and allow us to use this merge by mesh and allow us to use this merge by distance. And what that's going to do is distance. And what that's going to do is distance. And what that's going to do is just kill that duplicate curve. You just kill that duplicate curve. You just kill that duplicate curve. You couldn't see it visually, but in the couldn't see it visually, but in the couldn't see it visually, but in the data you would be able to recognize data you would be able to recognize data you would be able to recognize that. This just serves to delete the that. This just serves to delete the that. This just serves to delete the redundant curve. Now, what I'm going to redundant curve. Now, what I'm going to redundant curve. Now, what I'm going to do is get in a mesh to curve and then a curve to curve and then a curve to curve and then a curve to mesh. And then you get a curve mesh. And then you get a curve mesh. And then you get a curve circle. Feel like I say this every time, circle. Feel like I say this every time, circle. Feel like I say this every time, but we've done this a thousand times on but we've done this a thousand times on but we've done this a thousand times on the channel. We're creating a wireframe. the channel. We're creating a wireframe. the channel. We're creating a wireframe. And you just plug that there. And now we And you just plug that there. And now we And you just plug that there. And now we bring that radius down. You now have bring that radius down. You now have bring that radius down. You now have this. So, what we can do is take this this. So, what we can do is take this this. So, what we can do is take this set set set material node and just plug that into material node and just plug that into material node and just plug that into the join geometry. And we're back. If the join geometry. And we're back. If the join geometry. And we're back. If you want to kind of just appreciate it you want to kind of just appreciate it you want to kind of just appreciate it and see it, you can play with that noise and see it, you can play with that noise and see it, you can play with that noise texture. And now there's a curve. texture. And now there's a curve. texture. And now there's a curve. There's a line connected to each one of There's a line connected to each one of There's a line connected to each one of those image cubes. So, I'm going to go those image cubes. So, I'm going to go those image cubes. So, I'm going to go back here to the uh circle curve and I'm back here to the uh circle curve and I'm back here to the uh circle curve and I'm just going to bring it pretty far down. just going to bring it pretty far down. just going to bring it pretty far down. Something like that. And the resolution Something like that. And the resolution Something like that. And the resolution of four is really all you're going to of four is really all you're going to of four is really all you're going to need cuz it's going to be extremely need cuz it's going to be extremely need cuz it's going to be extremely thin. geometry isn't going to be very thin. geometry isn't going to be very thin. geometry isn't going to be very noticeable. Now it's white. It's just noticeable. Now it's white. It's just noticeable. Now it's white. It's just white by default. What you can do is get white by default. What you can do is get white by default. What you can do is get a set material node. Go over here. Click a set material node. Go over here. Click a set material node. Go over here. Click new. We're going to switch it over to an new. We're going to switch it over to an new. We're going to switch it over to an emission node and just make it a nice emission node and just make it a nice emission node and just make it a nice red. And then just go ahead and grab red. And then just go ahead and grab red. And then just go ahead and grab that red right there. And now we have that red right there. And now we have that red right there. And now we have these red lines. I'm going to go say these red lines. I'm going to go say these red lines. I'm going to go say maybe 05 might be good. I would even go maybe 05 might be good. I would even go maybe 05 might be good. I would even go even even even uh thinner on this. And then we need one uh thinner on this. And then we need one uh thinner on this. And then we need one more thing. I want to have these little more thing. I want to have these little more thing. I want to have these little cubes, um, these little planes at each cubes, um, these little planes at each cubes, um, these little planes at each connection. So, what I'm going to do is connection. So, what I'm going to do is connection. So, what I'm going to do is right here on the node that says mesh to right here on the node that says mesh to right here on the node that says mesh to points. What I'm going to points. What I'm going to points. What I'm going to do, we're going to get an instance on do, we're going to get an instance on do, we're going to get an instance on points points points node and just plug him into the points. node and just plug him into the points. node and just plug him into the points. Plug him into the join geometry and get a grid. And you're not going to see grid. And you're not going to see grid. And you're not going to see anything. It needs to be we're going to anything. It needs to be we're going to anything. It needs to be we're going to get a transform geometry node just to get a transform geometry node just to get a transform geometry node just to kind of bring it up a slight bit so that kind of bring it up a slight bit so that kind of bring it up a slight bit so that we can see it. And then you can just go we can see it. And then you can just go we can see it. And then you can just go also put that same also put that same also put that same material on that. So now we have the material on that. So now we have the material on that. So now we have the finished effect. If you go back to sort finished effect. If you go back to sort finished effect. If you go back to sort of the master of the master of the master noise, you can now see and appreciate noise, you can now see and appreciate noise, you can now see and appreciate this effect. And all we need to do is this effect. And all we need to do is this effect. And all we need to do is animate it. Uh because we kind of I like animate it. Uh because we kind of I like animate it. Uh because we kind of I like to go the extra mile and loop the to go the extra mile and loop the to go the extra mile and loop the animation. We're going to loop the W and animation. We're going to loop the W and animation. We're going to loop the W and the noise. And so we have our timeline the noise. And so we have our timeline the noise. And so we have our timeline down here. I'm going to stick with 250 down here. I'm going to stick with 250 down here. I'm going to stick with 250 frames. That's going to give you about I frames. That's going to give you about I frames. That's going to give you about I think a 10-second animation if I'm think a 10-second animation if I'm think a 10-second animation if I'm remembering right. And so I'm going to remembering right. And so I'm going to remembering right. And so I'm going to go ahead and bring my W to zero. I'm go ahead and bring my W to zero. I'm go ahead and bring my W to zero. I'm going to duplicate the noise. Get a mix going to duplicate the noise. Get a mix going to duplicate the noise. Get a mix color node. Mix color node. And plug color node. Mix color node. And plug color node. Mix color node. And plug factor there. And bring the factor over factor there. And bring the factor over factor there. And bring the factor over to the left. So right here on the W, you to the left. So right here on the W, you to the left. So right here on the W, you hit I to add a key frame. Hit I on the hit I to add a key frame. Hit I on the hit I to add a key frame. Hit I on the factor. And then we're going to go to factor. And then we're going to go to factor. And then we're going to go to the very end. And I'm going to say the very end. And I'm going to say the very end. And I'm going to say probably a value of probably a value of probably a value of five. And then we're going to slide this five. And then we're going to slide this five. And then we're going to slide this guy over and hit I. Hit I. Now that guy over and hit I. Hit I. Now that guy over and hit I. Hit I. Now that we're at the very end of the animation, we're at the very end of the animation, we're at the very end of the animation, hit your W. He should be zero. Go back hit your W. He should be zero. Go back hit your W. He should be zero. Go back to frame zero and do to frame zero and do to frame zero and do five. And there we go. Now we used a five. And there we go. Now we used a five. And there we go. Now we used a value of five and neg 5. If you want it value of five and neg 5. If you want it value of five and neg 5. If you want it faster, do like 10 negative 10. If you faster, do like 10 negative 10. If you faster, do like 10 negative 10. If you want it slower, do want it slower, do want it slower, do like.5gative.5. You kind of get the like.5gative.5. You kind of get the like.5gative.5. You kind of get the idea. But your values are going to idea. But your values are going to idea. But your values are going to create the speed of the animation. So, create the speed of the animation. So, create the speed of the animation. So, that's really going to dictate um how it that's really going to dictate um how it that's really going to dictate um how it looks. I would render this in the Eevee looks. I would render this in the Eevee looks. I would render this in the Eevee render engine. I think I'm in cycles render engine. I think I'm in cycles render engine. I think I'm in cycles right now. Yeah. Just switch over to right now. Yeah. Just switch over to right now. Yeah. Just switch over to Eevee. Press play. And you now have a Eevee. Press play. And you now have a Eevee. Press play. And you now have a really, really cool finished interesting really, really cool finished interesting really, really cool finished interesting looking touch designer effect. Um, and looking touch designer effect. Um, and looking touch designer effect. Um, and all points connect to all points. It's all points connect to all points. It's all points connect to all points. It's really cool. It's pretty useful. Um, really cool. It's pretty useful. Um, really cool. It's pretty useful. Um, especially just having some fun and especially just having some fun and especially just having some fun and glitching some things around. So, there glitching some things around. So, there glitching some things around. So, there you go. That is the full animation. You you go. That is the full animation. You you go. That is the full animation.
