## Summary
In this blender tutorial we will be using geometry nodes to create light trails that draw geometry as the camera moves.

## Notes
In this blender tutorial we will be using geometry nodes to create light trails that draw geometry as the camera moves. This is a powerful concept that you can use in many of your motion graphics animations and other related styles of animation￼. We will be using geometry nodes to create the curves, creating a mirror system in geometry notes so that the animation will be a stainless loop. And will be using transparency to reveal the geometry as the camera moves. ￼#geometrynodes #blender3d #tutorial ----------------------------- Patreon - https://patreon.com/user?u=9011118&utm_medium=clipboard_copy&utm_source=copyLink&utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator&utm_content=join_link ----------------------------------------------- 🌐 Connect with me: - Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/ducky3d/ - Twitter: https://twitter.com/Ducky3d

How's it going? So, in today's tutorial, How's it going? So, in today's tutorial, How's it going? So, in today's tutorial, we're going to be making this animation. we're going to be making this animation. we're going to be making this animation. It's honestly one of my favorite I've It's honestly one of my favorite I've It's honestly one of my favorite I've done in a really long time. First thing done in a really long time. First thing done in a really long time. First thing we're going to do is duplicate a bunch we're going to do is duplicate a bunch we're going to do is duplicate a bunch of curves and make sure that they are of curves and make sure that they are of curves and make sure that they are sitting in the right position. So, this sitting in the right position. So, this sitting in the right position. So, this animation is going to loop. Then, we're animation is going to loop. Then, we're animation is going to loop. Then, we're going to go ahead and displace the going to go ahead and displace the going to go ahead and displace the curves and shape that displacement to curves and shape that displacement to curves and shape that displacement to look more like a topographic map. Then, look more like a topographic map. Then, look more like a topographic map. Then, we're going to go ahead and parent a we're going to go ahead and parent a we're going to go ahead and parent a gradient to the camera movement, which gradient to the camera movement, which gradient to the camera movement, which is going to create the animation. Then, is going to create the animation. Then, is going to create the animation. Then, we're going to go ahead and edit that we're going to go ahead and edit that we're going to go ahead and edit that gradient to create a really cool glowing gradient to create a really cool glowing gradient to create a really cool glowing effect. And then after that, we're going effect. And then after that, we're going effect. And then after that, we're going to use a wave texture to select the to use a wave texture to select the to use a wave texture to select the center curves to make them brighter and center curves to make them brighter and center curves to make them brighter and create a really nice focal point. Then create a really nice focal point. Then create a really nice focal point. Then we're going to make a simple metallic we're going to make a simple metallic we're going to make a simple metallic floor material, and we'll be totally floor material, and we'll be totally floor material, and we'll be totally done. This animation is part of a series done. This animation is part of a series done. This animation is part of a series of tutorials here on YouTube that are of tutorials here on YouTube that are of tutorials here on YouTube that are inspired by topographic map art and inspired by topographic map art and inspired by topographic map art and animations. I'll be posting four of animations. I'll be posting four of animations.

With discount if you subscribe annually. With discount if you subscribe annually. With that being said, let's get into this that being said, let's get into this that being said, let's get into this tutorial. All right, I'm going to start tutorial. All right, I'm going to start tutorial. All right, I'm going to start uh and make my windows. So, I'm just uh and make my windows. So, I'm just uh and make my windows. So, I'm just going to go down in this, go up on that. going to go down in this, go up on that. going to go down in this, go up on that. I like my geometry nodes and my shading I like my geometry nodes and my shading I like my geometry nodes and my shading to be the same uh this ways. You can do to be the same uh this ways. You can do to be the same uh this ways. You can do however you want. There really is no however you want. There really is no however you want. There really is no technical benefit to doing either way. technical benefit to doing either way. technical benefit to doing either way. This is just what I preferably, this is This is just what I preferably, this is This is just what I preferably, this is my preference. Let's head into geometry my preference. Let's head into geometry my preference. Let's head into geometry nodes. First, let's hit shift A. Get a nodes. First, let's hit shift A. Get a nodes. First, let's hit shift A. Get a plane. I'm going to title this geo. You plane. I'm going to title this geo. You plane. I'm going to title this geo. You don't have to title it. Title it don't have to title it. Title it don't have to title it. Title it whatever you want. And we're going to whatever you want. And we're going to whatever you want. And we're going to click new here in geometry nodes. click new here in geometry nodes. click new here in geometry nodes. Delete. Shift A. And we're going to Delete. Shift A. And we're going to Delete. Shift A. And we're going to search a grid. And we're going to plug search a grid. And we're going to plug search a grid. And we're going to plug this right into here. We're delete that. this right into here. We're delete that. this right into here. We're delete that. I'm going to hit shift A and get a I'm going to hit shift A and get a I'm going to hit shift A and get a quadratic bezier. Plug that here. Let's quadratic bezier. Plug that here. Let's quadratic bezier. Plug that here. Let's do a couple edits here. So, one is a do a couple edits here. So, one is a do a couple edits here. So, one is a resolution of 300. And we are going to resolution of 300. And we are going to resolution of 300. And we are going to go ahead click and drag here. Hit zero. go ahead click and drag here. Hit zero. go ahead click and drag here. Hit zero. And then on the Y we're going to give it And then on the Y we're going to give it And then on the Y we're going to give it a scale of 10. And that is going to a scale of 10. And that is going to a scale of 10. And that is going to stretch it uh by essentially five units stretch it uh by essentially five units stretch it uh by essentially five units here, 10 units here, 10 uh 10 m. And uh here, 10 units here, 10 uh 10 m. And uh here, 10 units here, 10 uh 10 m. And uh we're happy with that. Now I want to do we're happy with that. Now I want to do we're happy with that. Now I want to do uh some duplicates down the line of this uh some duplicates down the line of this uh some duplicates down the line of this quadratic resier. the way I'm going to quadratic resier. the way I'm going to quadratic resier. the way I'm going to make my array. Typically, if I'm make my array. Typically, if I'm make my array. Typically, if I'm displacing immediately after uh making displacing immediately after uh making displacing immediately after uh making the array, I like to use a simulation the array, I like to use a simulation the array, I like to use a simulation zone for it. So, we're going to get a zone for it. So, we're going to get a zone for it. So, we're going to get a simulation and we're going to plug here, simulation and we're going to plug here, simulation and we're going to plug here, plug there, and then I'm just going to plug there, and then I'm just going to plug there, and then I'm just going to bring it down. Let's go ahead and get a bring it down. Let's go ahead and get a bring it down. Let's go ahead and get a I'm going to get a set position node, a I'm going to get a set position node, a I'm going to get a set position node, a join geometry, and then plug the curve join geometry, and then plug the curve join geometry, and then plug the curve into the join geometry. Just like that. into the join geometry. Just like that. into the join geometry. Just like that. I want to move it by I want to move it by I want to move it by 13 this direction. Now, when I press 13 this direction. Now, when I press 13 this direction. Now, when I press play, it is going to give me a bunch of play, it is going to give me a bunch of play, it is going to give me a bunch of duplicates. And I believe 77 is the duplicates. And I believe 77 is the duplicates. And I believe 77 is the amount that I wanted to go with. Then, amount that I wanted to go with. Then, amount that I wanted to go with. Then, once you're done, you can go ahead and once you're done, you can go ahead and once you're done, you can go ahead and get a bake node and bake it. And you're get a bake node and bake it. And you're get a bake node and bake it. And you're all set. Now, I'm going to go ahead get all set. Now, I'm going to go ahead get all set. Now, I'm going to go ahead get another set position node another set position node another set position node just to move it to the center of where just to move it to the center of where just to move it to the center of where I'll be working, using my camera, all of I'll be working, using my camera, all of I'll be working, using my camera, all of that, just to keep everything uh in this that, just to keep everything uh in this that, just to keep everything uh in this loop working correctly. So, I'm going to loop working correctly. So, I'm going to loop working correctly. So, I'm going to go ahead on the X and the Y and do a go ahead on the X and the Y and do a go ahead on the X and the Y and do a negative five. And that is just going to negative five. And that is just going to negative five. And that is just going to plop it exactly where I'd want it to be. plop it exactly where I'd want it to be. plop it exactly where I'd want it to be. Now, we can get our set position node Now, we can get our set position node Now, we can get our set position node that is going to create our actual that is going to create our actual that is going to create our actual displacement. So, let's get a another displacement. So, let's get a another displacement. So, let's get a another set position node. We're going to get a set position node. We're going to get a set position node. We're going to get a combine XYZ node. Plug that into the combine XYZ node. Plug that into the combine XYZ node. Plug that into the offset. And let's plug a noise texture offset. And let's plug a noise texture offset. And let's plug a noise texture into the Z. So, we'll get that noise. into the Z. So, we'll get that noise. into the Z. So, we'll get that noise. Plug color into the Z. Now, we have some Plug color into the Z. Now, we have some Plug color into the Z. Now, we have some displacement. I'm going to go ahead and displacement. I'm going to go ahead and displacement. I'm going to go ahead and click on normalize. Give myself a scale click on normalize. Give myself a scale click on normalize. Give myself a scale of 0.5. That looks really good. And then of 0.5. That looks really good. And then of 0.5. That looks really good. And then let's get a vector math node so that we let's get a vector math node so that we let's get a vector math node so that we can play with the strength of this can play with the strength of this can play with the strength of this effect. We're going to click on scale. effect. We're going to click on scale. effect. We're going to click on scale. And that is just going to be a scale And that is just going to be a scale And that is just going to be a scale like a scale value here. So I'm just like a scale value here. So I'm just like a scale value here. So I'm just going to keep it at one for now. And going to keep it at one for now. And going to keep it at one for now. And what I don't want is if I look at here what I don't want is if I look at here what I don't want is if I look at here from the uh right or the left, I want it from the uh right or the left, I want it from the uh right or the left, I want it to kind of cut off. I want there to be to kind of cut off. I want there to be to kind of cut off. I want there to be some flat portions. Right now it's like some flat portions. Right now it's like some flat portions. Right now it's like all wave. I want some portions where it all wave. I want some portions where it all wave. I want some portions where it goes down to look like the flat ground. goes down to look like the flat ground. goes down to look like the flat ground. And so the way I can do that, the way I And so the way I can do that, the way I And so the way I can do that, the way I prefer to do it, you can use color ramp. prefer to do it, you can use color ramp. prefer to do it, you can use color ramp. That will just straight up crunch it That will just straight up crunch it That will just straight up crunch it flat. That's not that fun. So we're flat. That's not that fun. So we're flat. That's not that fun. So we're going to do a going to do a going to do a RGB curves node. I'm going to add a RGB curves node. I'm going to add a RGB curves node. I'm going to add a point here, here, here. And then the point here, here, here. And then the point here, here, here. And then the part that's the most important, I'm part that's the most important, I'm part that's the most important, I'm going to add a point right here in the going to add a point right here in the going to add a point right here in the middle of this bottom square. Bring this middle of this bottom square. Bring this middle of this bottom square. Bring this up. And that's going to create these up. And that's going to create these up. And that's going to create these flat portions, but that aren't perfectly flat portions, but that aren't perfectly flat portions, but that aren't perfectly flat. It's going to give you, maybe the flat. It's going to give you, maybe the flat. It's going to give you, maybe the word nuance might be fun. It's going to word nuance might be fun. It's going to word nuance might be fun. It's going to give you a little bit of nuance in the give you a little bit of nuance in the give you a little bit of nuance in the flat portions, but not flat portions, but not flat portions, but not completely kill um our ability to have completely kill um our ability to have completely kill um our ability to have it more flat. And maybe we can bring it it more flat. And maybe we can bring it it more flat. And maybe we can bring it down like this. Give it some more flat down like this. Give it some more flat down like this. Give it some more flat areas. Um and then you can play with areas. Um and then you can play with areas. Um and then you can play with that scale to give some parts that go that scale to give some parts that go that scale to give some parts that go up. So now we have some flat parts that up. So now we have some flat parts that up. So now we have some flat parts that are still a little bit wavy. And those are still a little bit wavy. And those are still a little bit wavy. And those are really going to be pronounced once are really going to be pronounced once are really going to be pronounced once we're playing with this animation some we're playing with this animation some we're playing with this animation some more. So now we have this ready to go. more. So now we have this ready to go. more. So now we have this ready to go. Now we are going to be making a looping Now we are going to be making a looping Now we are going to be making a looping animation. And the biggest part of animation. And the biggest part of animation. And the biggest part of making this loop is is uh the first and making this loop is is uh the first and making this loop is is uh the first and the last frame needing to look exactly the last frame needing to look exactly the last frame needing to look exactly the same so that this is a seamless the same so that this is a seamless the same so that this is a seamless looping animation. The problem is if I looping animation. The problem is if I looping animation. The problem is if I duplicate this tech this uh geometry duplicate this tech this uh geometry duplicate this tech this uh geometry nodes nodes nodes uh whatever we're going to call it uh uh whatever we're going to call it uh uh whatever we're going to call it uh object you could see how you can see a object you could see how you can see a object you could see how you can see a seam or you know a very obvious seam. seam or you know a very obvious seam. seam or you know a very obvious seam. You can see how it does not connect from You can see how it does not connect from You can see how it does not connect from one duplicate to the next. How can I one duplicate to the next. How can I one duplicate to the next. How can I duplicate this texture but make it so duplicate this texture but make it so duplicate this texture but make it so that it connects? Because if we can't do that it connects? Because if we can't do that it connects? Because if we can't do that, this animation breaks. So what I that, this animation breaks. So what I that, this animation breaks. So what I need to do is first mirror this need to do is first mirror this need to do is first mirror this displacement. Then I can duplicate the displacement. Then I can duplicate the displacement. Then I can duplicate the displacement. So what I can do is get a displacement. So what I can do is get a displacement. So what I can do is get a transform geometry node and a join transform geometry node and a join transform geometry node and a join geometry node and then plug this into geometry node and then plug this into geometry node and then plug this into the join. Now we what we've done is made the join. Now we what we've done is made the join. Now we what we've done is made a duplicate. So remember a duplicate. So remember a duplicate. So remember we uh made this 10 this a scale of 10 we uh made this 10 this a scale of 10 we uh made this 10 this a scale of 10 which means here on the here on the Y if which means here on the here on the Y if which means here on the here on the Y if I here on the Y if I move it down by 10 I here on the Y if I move it down by 10 I here on the Y if I move it down by 10 it's going to perfectly move it down it's going to perfectly move it down it's going to perfectly move it down this direction and then here on the this direction and then here on the this direction and then here on the scale if I do a negative one it is going scale if I do a negative one it is going scale if I do a negative one it is going to flip that and now it mirrors our to flip that and now it mirrors our to flip that and now it mirrors our displacement. There is a discernable displacement. There is a discernable displacement. There is a discernable seam. It's not super obvious, especially seam. It's not super obvious, especially seam. It's not super obvious, especially if you're just a viewer of the if you're just a viewer of the if you're just a viewer of the animation. You're not looking for it. animation. You're not looking for it. animation. You're not looking for it. Um, if this bothers you, there's really Um, if this bothers you, there's really Um, if this bothers you, there's really not much you can do about it. But we now not much you can do about it. But we now not much you can do about it. But we now have made uh a a mirror of this. So now have made uh a a mirror of this. So now have made uh a a mirror of this. So now what I can do is get another what I can do is get another what I can do is get another transfer uh transform geometry node, transfer uh transform geometry node, transfer uh transform geometry node, join geometry, make another duplicate, join geometry, make another duplicate, join geometry, make another duplicate, and move this guy down by 20. Now, we and move this guy down by 20. Now, we and move this guy down by 20. Now, we can just literally duplicate, duplicate, can just literally duplicate, duplicate, can just literally duplicate, duplicate, duplicate, and this is a seamless duplicate, and this is a seamless duplicate, and this is a seamless pattern. So, that's what we're that's pattern. So, that's what we're that's pattern. So, that's what we're that's what I wanted to make in order for this what I wanted to make in order for this what I wanted to make in order for this animation to loop seamlessly. So, now animation to loop seamlessly. So, now animation to loop seamlessly. So, now let's go ahead and give this a little let's go ahead and give this a little let's go ahead and give this a little bit of geometry. So, I'm going to do a bit of geometry. So, I'm going to do a bit of geometry. So, I'm going to do a curve to mesh and a curve and a curve and a curve circle. Uh just to keep this a little circle. Uh just to keep this a little circle. Uh just to keep this a little bit lighter, I'm going to do a bit lighter, I'm going to do a bit lighter, I'm going to do a resolution of uh four, a radius of 0005, resolution of uh four, a radius of 0005, resolution of uh four, a radius of 0005, and then I'm going to plug this right and then I'm going to plug this right and then I'm going to plug this right into the profile curve. Now we have some into the profile curve. Now we have some into the profile curve. Now we have some actual geometry we can add a material actual geometry we can add a material actual geometry we can add a material to, which is uh this is going to be a to, which is uh this is going to be a to, which is uh this is going to be a great time to start adding materials. So great time to start adding materials. So great time to start adding materials. So we're going to get a set material node. we're going to get a set material node. we're going to get a set material node. We're going to go here to the shading, We're going to go here to the shading, We're going to go here to the shading, create a material, and then grab it create a material, and then grab it create a material, and then grab it right here. You can even name it right here. You can even name it right here. You can even name it And you can see that's the uh that's the And you can see that's the uh that's the And you can see that's the uh that's the material we made. So what I can do right material we made. So what I can do right material we made. So what I can do right now is before we create the material, I now is before we create the material, I now is before we create the material, I want to get the camera moving because want to get the camera moving because want to get the camera moving because the camera is going to affect the the camera is going to affect the the camera is going to affect the shading. So let's let's do that. I'm shading. So let's let's do that. I'm shading. So let's let's do that. I'm going to go ahead and show you guys my going to go ahead and show you guys my going to go ahead and show you guys my method for kind of making sure loops method for kind of making sure loops method for kind of making sure loops loop. So I know that I scaled this these loop. So I know that I scaled this these loop. So I know that I scaled this these strings are 10 m long. So that means in strings are 10 m long. So that means in strings are 10 m long. So that means in real space here if I hit S5 that is how real space here if I hit S5 that is how real space here if I hit S5 that is how big our object our you know our big our object our you know our big our object our you know our scene our object is and then we just scene our object is and then we just scene our object is and then we just then we mirrored it right at there and then we mirrored it right at there and then we mirrored it right at there and so our camera needs to go so our camera needs to go so our camera needs to go uh the length of two of these cubes I uh the length of two of these cubes I uh the length of two of these cubes I mean two of these planes. And if we do mean two of these planes. And if we do mean two of these planes. And if we do that that that it's going to loop. So, I'm going to go it's going to loop. So, I'm going to go it's going to loop. So, I'm going to go ahead and just set up my camera view, my ahead and just set up my camera view, my ahead and just set up my camera view, my camera angle, however I want it to be. camera angle, however I want it to be. camera angle, however I want it to be. Something like this. Something like this. Something like this. And then I'm get a camera control, alt0, And then I'm get a camera control, alt0, And then I'm get a camera control, alt0, snap it to view. I like, if we go here snap it to view. I like, if we go here snap it to view. I like, if we go here to the camera settings, a focal length to the camera settings, a focal length to the camera settings, a focal length of 100. That really gives it this nice of 100. That really gives it this nice of 100. That really gives it this nice flat view. And then I'm just going to flat view. And then I'm just going to flat view. And then I'm just going to tighten my view in a little bit till all tighten my view in a little bit till all tighten my view in a little bit till all the strings are within view. Now, what I the strings are within view. Now, what I the strings are within view. Now, what I can do is I'm going hit the tilda key can do is I'm going hit the tilda key can do is I'm going hit the tilda key and go to the top. I'm actually also and go to the top. I'm actually also and go to the top. I'm actually also going to take I'm going to delete this going to take I'm going to delete this going to take I'm going to delete this just to make sure you guys know what's just to make sure you guys know what's just to make sure you guys know what's going on. Take this plane and hit alt d. going on. Take this plane and hit alt d. going on. Take this plane and hit alt d. That is going to create an instance. And That is going to create an instance. And That is going to create an instance. And then hold down control and that is going then hold down control and that is going then hold down control and that is going to snap everything. I neglected to say to snap everything. I neglected to say to snap everything. I neglected to say that. Make sure that you are snapping that. Make sure that you are snapping that. Make sure that you are snapping and then hitting alt d. And I'm hit alt and then hitting alt d. And I'm hit alt and then hitting alt d. And I'm hit alt d again. And so what happens is when I d again. And so what happens is when I d again. And so what happens is when I add a material to him, it'll add a add a material to him, it'll add a add a material to him, it'll add a material to these instances that I just material to these instances that I just material to these instances that I just created. So again, holding down control created. So again, holding down control created. So again, holding down control so that this animation will perfectly so that this animation will perfectly so that this animation will perfectly loop. And so now what I'm going to do is loop. And so now what I'm going to do is loop. And so now what I'm going to do is I'm hit the tilt key, go to the top, and I'm hit the tilt key, go to the top, and I'm hit the tilt key, go to the top, and the camera needs to start exactly on the camera needs to start exactly on the camera needs to start exactly on this line here at the very very exact this line here at the very very exact this line here at the very very exact edge of this uh cube, which is the exact edge of this uh cube, which is the exact edge of this uh cube, which is the exact edge of this geometry node scene. So I edge of this geometry node scene. So I edge of this geometry node scene. So I know that it needs to be know that it needs to be know that it needs to be five. You can kind of see this thicker five. You can kind of see this thicker five. You can kind of see this thicker line right here coinciding with that. line right here coinciding with that. line right here coinciding with that. So, let's cut our let's get our So, let's cut our let's get our So, let's cut our let's get our animation. So, I'm going to hit the back animation. So, I'm going to hit the back animation. So, I'm going to hit the back arrow and then hit the back arrow again arrow and then hit the back arrow again arrow and then hit the back arrow again on my keyboard to go to frame zero. And on my keyboard to go to frame zero. And on my keyboard to go to frame zero. And then you can double check in your then you can double check in your then you can double check in your animation preferences. Your default animation preferences. Your default animation preferences. Your default interpolation is linear. That is going interpolation is linear. That is going interpolation is linear. That is going to ensure a perfect loop. I'm going to to ensure a perfect loop. I'm going to to ensure a perfect loop. I'm going to give myself 400 frames. Let me start my give myself 400 frames. Let me start my give myself 400 frames. Let me start my camera at -5. I'm going to bring my uh camera at -5. I'm going to bring my uh camera at -5. I'm going to bring my uh cursor to 400. I don't think cursor was cursor to 400. I don't think cursor was cursor to 400. I don't think cursor was the right word. I'm going hold down the right word. I'm going hold down the right word. I'm going hold down control, bring it all the way to the control, bring it all the way to the control, bring it all the way to the edge of this second plane right here. edge of this second plane right here. edge of this second plane right here. And you can double check. If it says 15, And you can double check. If it says 15, And you can double check. If it says 15, you're in the right place. And now, you're in the right place. And now, you're in the right place. And now, if I press play, let's watch the if I press play, let's watch the if I press play, let's watch the animation. And uh wow, it's really slow. animation. And uh wow, it's really slow. animation. And uh wow, it's really slow. Now, if I press play, Now, if I press play, Now, if I press play, that's very, very slow, which is weird. that's very, very slow, which is weird. that's very, very slow, which is weird. That didn't happen when I rehearsed That didn't happen when I rehearsed That didn't happen when I rehearsed this. If it is really slow, you're not this. If it is really slow, you're not this. If it is really slow, you're not getting any good playback, it's lagging getting any good playback, it's lagging getting any good playback, it's lagging out. Um, what you can do is go back to out. Um, what you can do is go back to out. Um, what you can do is go back to geometry nodes and get a geometry nodes and get a geometry nodes and get a reample curve node. And I'll just plop reample curve node. And I'll just plop reample curve node. And I'll just plop it right before the curve to mesh. And it right before the curve to mesh. And it right before the curve to mesh. And that's going to just bring make your that's going to just bring make your that's going to just bring make your essentially your curves low poly. And it essentially your curves low poly. And it essentially your curves low poly. And it should Okay. Yeah. So that'll make your should Okay. Yeah. So that'll make your should Okay. Yeah. So that'll make your scene a little bit lighter. You could scene a little bit lighter. You could scene a little bit lighter. You could remove that later. And so now we have remove that later. And so now we have remove that later. And so now we have this. If we just watch the animation this. If we just watch the animation this. If we just watch the animation play through all the way to the end. So play through all the way to the end. So play through all the way to the end. So we'll just wait around. We're just going we'll just wait around. We're just going we'll just wait around. We're just going to double check that this animation is to double check that this animation is to double check that this animation is going to loop seamlessly. So, we're going to loop seamlessly. So, we're going to loop seamlessly. So, we're watching and then once we get to the edge, just and then once we get to the edge, just and then once we get to the edge, just pay attention. Okay, loop seamlessly. pay attention. Okay, loop seamlessly. pay attention. Okay, loop seamlessly. 400 to zero. So, now we have that, we 400 to zero. So, now we have that, we 400 to zero. So, now we have that, we can go ahead and start working on our can go ahead and start working on our can go ahead and start working on our shading shading shading because the camera's going, like I said, because the camera's going, like I said, because the camera's going, like I said, the camera is going to heavily affect the camera is going to heavily affect the camera is going to heavily affect the shading. So, I'm going to go back to the shading. So, I'm going to go back to the shading. So, I'm going to go back to geometry nodes and I'm going to mute geometry nodes and I'm going to mute geometry nodes and I'm going to mute that uh that uh that uh that reample curve node. that reample curve node. that reample curve node. So, we can go here now to the shading. So, we can go here now to the shading. So, we can go here now to the shading. And we have that material that we And we have that material that we And we have that material that we labeled dude for no reason. Um, and then labeled dude for no reason. Um, and then labeled dude for no reason. Um, and then you can create this in EV or cycles. So, you can create this in EV or cycles. So, you can create this in EV or cycles. So, I'm just going to design this in EV. I'm I'm just going to design this in EV. I'm I'm just going to design this in EV. I'm going to personally render this in going to personally render this in going to personally render this in cycles cuz it just looks better. So, I'm cycles cuz it just looks better. So, I'm cycles cuz it just looks better. So, I'm going to go down here and give myself an going to go down here and give myself an going to go down here and give myself an emission strength of three. We can now emission strength of three. We can now emission strength of three. We can now see this um this object. Now, I'm going see this um this object. Now, I'm going see this um this object. Now, I'm going to go ahead get my color ramp, plug it to go ahead get my color ramp, plug it to go ahead get my color ramp, plug it into the color, and I'm going to plug it into the color, and I'm going to plug it into the color, and I'm going to plug it into the alpha. into the alpha. into the alpha. Let's get a Let's get a Let's get a gradient texture. And if you have the gradient texture. And if you have the gradient texture. And if you have the node wrangler add-on enabled, comes with node wrangler add-on enabled, comes with node wrangler add-on enabled, comes with Blender by default. Just hit control T Blender by default. Just hit control T Blender by default. Just hit control T or get a mapping node and a texture or get a mapping node and a texture or get a mapping node and a texture coordinate node and plug in the object. coordinate node and plug in the object. coordinate node and plug in the object. And then plug color into color ramp. and And then plug color into color ramp. and And then plug color into color ramp. and you're going to see this gradient you're going to see this gradient you're going to see this gradient working. Now, in Eevee, see how it's working. Now, in Eevee, see how it's working. Now, in Eevee, see how it's like this noisy transparency. You can go like this noisy transparency. You can go like this noisy transparency. You can go here to the material settings and go here to the material settings and go here to the material settings and go from dithered to blended. And that's from dithered to blended. And that's from dithered to blended. And that's going to give you sort of that OG Eevee going to give you sort of that OG Eevee going to give you sort of that OG Eevee looking uh transparency. And then here looking uh transparency. And then here looking uh transparency. And then here on the rotation, I'm going to do a on the rotation, I'm going to do a on the rotation, I'm going to do a rotate it by 90° rotate it by 90° rotate it by 90° so that it it's going the right so that it it's going the right so that it it's going the right direction that I want. So, one thing we direction that I want. So, one thing we direction that I want. So, one thing we need to do, I'm going hit shift A and need to do, I'm going hit shift A and need to do, I'm going hit shift A and get an empty plane axis. What we're get an empty plane axis. What we're get an empty plane axis. What we're going to do there is now I'm going to going to do there is now I'm going to going to do there is now I'm going to click back on my uh curves and I'm going click back on my uh curves and I'm going click back on my uh curves and I'm going to go over here to the object coordinate to go over here to the object coordinate to go over here to the object coordinate and grab the empty. So, what's going to and grab the empty. So, what's going to and grab the empty. So, what's going to happen now is when I click on my empty happen now is when I click on my empty happen now is when I click on my empty and I move the empty around, that and I move the empty around, that and I move the empty around, that controls the position of the gradient. controls the position of the gradient. controls the position of the gradient. So, here's what's cool. I'm going to So, here's what's cool. I'm going to So, here's what's cool. I'm going to click on the camera. I'm going hold down click on the camera. I'm going hold down click on the camera. I'm going hold down shift, click on the empty. Crl P and shift, click on the empty. Crl P and shift, click on the empty. Crl P and click on object. Now what's going to click on object. Now what's going to click on object. Now what's going to happen is I'm hit this drop down, click happen is I'm hit this drop down, click happen is I'm hit this drop down, click on my empty and just bring it forward a on my empty and just bring it forward a on my empty and just bring it forward a little bit. When I press play, that transparency is going to the that transparency is going to the that transparency is going to the because the empty is mapped to the because the empty is mapped to the because the empty is mapped to the camera. As this camera moves, it's going camera. As this camera moves, it's going camera. As this camera moves, it's going to write or you know it kind of looks to write or you know it kind of looks to write or you know it kind of looks like it's writing the geometry writing like it's writing the geometry writing like it's writing the geometry writing these waves this sort of topographic map these waves this sort of topographic map these waves this sort of topographic map vibe. So that is that is what I wanted. vibe. So that is that is what I wanted. vibe. So that is that is what I wanted. So, that is how we create this really So, that is how we create this really So, that is how we create this really cool effect. I'm going to go ahead and cool effect. I'm going to go ahead and cool effect. I'm going to go ahead and make a uh timeline down here just for make a uh timeline down here just for make a uh timeline down here just for me. Wherever it is. me. Wherever it is. me. Wherever it is. So, now we can start making this look So, now we can start making this look So, now we can start making this look really cool. So, go ahead and just click really cool. So, go ahead and just click really cool. So, go ahead and just click on geo. We're going to go back here to on geo. We're going to go back here to on geo. We're going to go back here to the the uh the color ramp. I'm going to the the uh the color ramp. I'm going to the the uh the color ramp. I'm going to get a brand new node here. And then I'm get a brand new node here. And then I'm get a brand new node here. And then I'm going to make it red so you guys can going to make it red so you guys can going to make it red so you guys can kind of see the differentiation of what kind of see the differentiation of what kind of see the differentiation of what what things are doing what. what things are doing what. what things are doing what. This black portion is what we don't see This black portion is what we don't see This black portion is what we don't see over here. It's the same thing that's over here. It's the same thing that's over here. It's the same thing that's creating the alpha. So over here is creating the alpha. So over here is creating the alpha. So over here is represented by this black node. And then represented by this black node. And then represented by this black node. And then this white node is all the stuff behind this white node is all the stuff behind this white node is all the stuff behind it. And this red one is obviously this it. And this red one is obviously this it. And this red one is obviously this middle section. So what we can do middle section. So what we can do middle section. So what we can do is I can just make it is I can just make it is I can just make it a pure white. Make it the brightest a pure white. Make it the brightest a pure white. Make it the brightest thing. And this make it that darker thing. And this make it that darker thing. And this make it that darker portion. And then bring this in. Bring portion. And then bring this in. Bring portion. And then bring this in. Bring this in. And I'm actually going to this in. And I'm actually going to this in. And I'm actually going to switch it over to constant so that switch it over to constant so that switch it over to constant so that there's no fade between the two. there's no fade between the two. there's no fade between the two. And then I can just bring this in so we And then I can just bring this in so we And then I can just bring this in so we have this one really bright section of have this one really bright section of have this one really bright section of the curves. So that's how we create that the curves. So that's how we create that the curves. So that's how we create that really cool effect. And then we can head really cool effect. And then we can head really cool effect. And then we can head into the compositing. Turn on use nodes, into the compositing. Turn on use nodes, into the compositing. Turn on use nodes, get a glare node, and turn on get a glare node, and turn on get a glare node, and turn on fog glow. And then we can head back to fog glow. And then we can head back to fog glow. And then we can head back to shading and then turn on always. And shading and then turn on always. And shading and then turn on always. And that's how we get that glare. So you can that's how we get that glare. So you can that's how we get that glare. So you can bring this up. bring this up. bring this up. Just like that. So what I'm going to do Just like that. So what I'm going to do Just like that. So what I'm going to do is bring this gray portion a little bit is bring this gray portion a little bit is bring this gray portion a little bit brighter to be something right around brighter to be something right around brighter to be something right around here. here. here. And then let's do a really cool thing. And then let's do a really cool thing. And then let's do a really cool thing. What I want to do is have a focal point What I want to do is have a focal point What I want to do is have a focal point right here in the middle of the curve so right here in the middle of the curve so right here in the middle of the curve so that it's not all just like all of them that it's not all just like all of them that it's not all just like all of them the same brightness. I think having this the same brightness. I think having this the same brightness. I think having this really cool focal point will make this really cool focal point will make this really cool focal point will make this stand out. So, I'm going to go ahead and stand out. So, I'm going to go ahead and stand out. So, I'm going to go ahead and get a mix color node. I'm going to hit get a mix color node. I'm going to hit get a mix color node. I'm going to hit control shift D. So, duplicate the color control shift D. So, duplicate the color control shift D. So, duplicate the color amp. Make sure the gradient is plugged amp. Make sure the gradient is plugged amp. Make sure the gradient is plugged into it. And plug this into B. And I'm into it. And plug this into B. And I'm into it. And plug this into B. And I'm just bring the factor over on this on just bring the factor over on this on just bring the factor over on this on this one here. I'm going to get a hue this one here. I'm going to get a hue this one here. I'm going to get a hue saturation value node. saturation value node. saturation value node. And I'm going to bring the value down to And I'm going to bring the value down to And I'm going to bring the value down to zero. So now we have a color ramp that's zero. So now we have a color ramp that's zero. So now we have a color ramp that's going to mix going to mix going to mix between a zero one with a value of zero between a zero one with a value of zero between a zero one with a value of zero and the default. And we're going to use and the default. And we're going to use and the default. And we're going to use a wave texture to make what kind of a wave texture to make what kind of a wave texture to make what kind of looks like a selection of the middle looks like a selection of the middle looks like a selection of the middle ones. So let's get a wave texture. ones. So let's get a wave texture. ones. So let's get a wave texture. Let's get in a Let's get in a Let's get in a let's plug the mapping into that. And we let's plug the mapping into that. And we let's plug the mapping into that. And we need to get a color ramp. need to get a color ramp. need to get a color ramp. Plug him here and plug him into the Plug him here and plug him into the Plug him here and plug him into the factor so we can differentiate. So now factor so we can differentiate. So now factor so we can differentiate. So now the wave texture is creating this. Now the wave texture is creating this. Now the wave texture is creating this. Now if you like this effect, go nuts. Go if you like this effect, go nuts. Go if you like this effect, go nuts. Go with it. We're actually going to go from with it. We're actually going to go from with it. We're actually going to go from X to Y and it's going to create this X to Y and it's going to create this X to Y and it's going to create this selection here. So I'm going to bring selection here. So I'm going to bring selection here. So I'm going to bring the color ramp in like this. And then I'm just going to bring that And then I'm just going to bring that And then I'm just going to bring that phase to make this in the middle. So see phase to make this in the middle. So see phase to make this in the middle. So see how it's over there? It's still a wave. how it's over there? It's still a wave. how it's over there? It's still a wave. We're just sort of making the wave big We're just sort of making the wave big We're just sort of making the wave big enough enough enough so that this selection is happening so that this selection is happening so that this selection is happening here. So I want maybe that many of the here. So I want maybe that many of the here. So I want maybe that many of the middle. And then we can go back to the middle. And then we can go back to the middle. And then we can go back to the hue sat node and bring the value up a hue sat node and bring the value up a hue sat node and bring the value up a little bit. So now we have these middle little bit. So now we have these middle little bit. So now we have these middle ones brighter than the side ones. And it ones brighter than the side ones. And it ones brighter than the side ones. And it looks super cool. All right. So let's uh looks super cool. All right. So let's uh looks super cool. All right. So let's uh let's get this let's get this animation let's get this let's get this animation let's get this let's get this animation over with. One thing I want to do, bring over with. One thing I want to do, bring over with. One thing I want to do, bring this over. I'm going to get another this over. I'm going to get another this over. I'm going to get another mix color node and I'm going to plug mix color node and I'm going to plug mix color node and I'm going to plug this final mix color into the factor. this final mix color into the factor. this final mix color into the factor. I'm going to make this one up here I'm going to make this one up here I'm going to make this one up here black, this one up here white, and then black, this one up here white, and then black, this one up here white, and then just change the color. So, you can use just change the color. So, you can use just change the color. So, you can use this mix node to change the color of all this mix node to change the color of all this mix node to change the color of all these things because then you'd have to these things because then you'd have to these things because then you'd have to go like into each one, make sure the go like into each one, make sure the go like into each one, make sure the color is this is sort of your master color is this is sort of your master color is this is sort of your master color. And then we can just bring that color. And then we can just bring that color. And then we can just bring that brightness up a little bit so we can brightness up a little bit so we can brightness up a little bit so we can still get our glare. And this is getting still get our glare. And this is getting still get our glare. And this is getting a nice color. Something like this. All a nice color. Something like this. All a nice color. Something like this. All right, let's now focus on the floor right, let's now focus on the floor right, let's now focus on the floor material. Make that pretty. And we're material. Make that pretty. And we're material. Make that pretty. And we're going to be done. So I'm going to switch going to be done. So I'm going to switch going to be done. So I'm going to switch over to cycles. over to cycles. over to cycles. And then I'm going hit this drop down And then I'm going hit this drop down And then I'm going hit this drop down scene scene world scene lights just so scene scene world scene lights just so scene scene world scene lights just so we can see what we're doing. So I'm we can see what we're doing. So I'm we can see what we're doing. So I'm going to click this first plane right up going to click this first plane right up going to click this first plane right up here in my outliner. I'm going to click here in my outliner. I'm going to click here in my outliner. I'm going to click new. I'm going to make it metallic. new. I'm going to make it metallic. new. I'm going to make it metallic. And then you can change the color just And then you can change the color just And then you can change the color just to make sure you know. Yep. This is to make sure you know. Yep. This is to make sure you know. Yep. This is affecting everything. Cool. So, what I affecting everything. Cool. So, what I affecting everything. Cool. So, what I want to do is one, turn on my dinoiser. want to do is one, turn on my dinoiser. want to do is one, turn on my dinoiser. So, we're going to get in a color ramp, So, we're going to get in a color ramp, So, we're going to get in a color ramp, plug that into the roughness. We're plug that into the roughness. We're plug that into the roughness. We're going to get in a voronoi texture. We're going to get in a voronoi texture. We're going to get in a voronoi texture. We're going to hit control T, use the object going to hit control T, use the object going to hit control T, use the object coordinate, and use color, plug that coordinate, and use color, plug that coordinate, and use color, plug that into the color amp. So, now we're going into the color amp. So, now we're going into the color amp. So, now we're going to get this really nice pattern. bring to get this really nice pattern. bring to get this really nice pattern. bring random to the left and give it a scale random to the left and give it a scale random to the left and give it a scale of 60. of 60. of 60. And then right here, this black portion And then right here, this black portion And then right here, this black portion of the color ramp represents the most of the color ramp represents the most of the color ramp represents the most like shiny, most reflective portions of like shiny, most reflective portions of like shiny, most reflective portions of this texture. I'm just going to bring it this texture. I'm just going to bring it this texture. I'm just going to bring it up just a little bit so it's not up just a little bit so it's not up just a little bit so it's not perfectly mirror like. And then I'm perfectly mirror like. And then I'm perfectly mirror like. And then I'm going to bring this one down a little going to bring this one down a little going to bring this one down a little bit so that everything is kind of in bit so that everything is kind of in bit so that everything is kind of in that middle ground. You can see how it's that middle ground. You can see how it's that middle ground. You can see how it's looking over there over here. Next thing looking over there over here. Next thing looking over there over here. Next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to get a I'm going to do is I'm going to get a I'm going to do is I'm going to get a bump node. plug color into height, bump node. plug color into height, bump node. plug color into height, normal to normal. And then I'm going to normal to normal. And then I'm going to normal to normal. And then I'm going to do a filter width of 1.5. do a filter width of 1.5. do a filter width of 1.5. That's going to give us this nice That's going to give us this nice That's going to give us this nice bumpiness that's going to affect the bumpiness that's going to affect the bumpiness that's going to affect the light. Last thing I want to do is I'm light. Last thing I want to do is I'm light. Last thing I want to do is I'm going to click on my wires here. I'm going to click on my wires here. I'm going to click on my wires here. I'm going to hover over here and hit Ctrl + going to hover over here and hit Ctrl + going to hover over here and hit Ctrl + C. Go back over here. C. Go back over here. C. Go back over here. We're going to get a color ramp. We're going to get a color ramp. We're going to get a color ramp. I'm going to click on the white one and I'm going to click on the white one and I'm going to click on the white one and just Ctrl +V. Paste that color into just Ctrl +V. Paste that color into just Ctrl +V. Paste that color into there. Color here. color of the voronoi. there. Color here. color of the voronoi. there. Color here. color of the voronoi. Plug it into that. And then we're going Plug it into that. And then we're going Plug it into that. And then we're going to give it a strength of like three. to give it a strength of like three. to give it a strength of like three. I'mma hit this drop down. We're just I'mma hit this drop down. We're just I'mma hit this drop down. We're just going to go back to our normal lights going to go back to our normal lights going to go back to our normal lights and then bring this black portion of the and then bring this black portion of the and then bring this black portion of the color amp in until we get enough of color amp in until we get enough of color amp in until we get enough of these little orange pieces. these little orange pieces. these little orange pieces. What that gives us is if I get my world What that gives us is if I get my world What that gives us is if I get my world brightness to be black, brightness to be black, brightness to be black, a little bit of context of, oh, there's a little bit of context of, oh, there's a little bit of context of, oh, there's some still some stuff over there. some still some stuff over there. some still some stuff over there. Because if I look at this in Eevee, let Because if I look at this in Eevee, let Because if I look at this in Eevee, let me just get my normal lights. As we're me just get my normal lights. As we're me just get my normal lights. As we're moving, those little cubes are going to moving, those little cubes are going to moving, those little cubes are going to move at us. And I just think that makes move at us. And I just think that makes move at us. And I just think that makes gives this a little bit more context. gives this a little bit more context. gives this a little bit more context. I'm going to go and move my I'm going to go and move my I'm going to go and move my um empty up a little bit. I want more of um empty up a little bit. I want more of um empty up a little bit. I want more of these waves to be making up this scene. these waves to be making up this scene. these waves to be making up this scene. So, this is what we have so far. What I So, this is what we have so far. What I So, this is what we have so far. What I want to do is bring down the value of want to do is bring down the value of want to do is bring down the value of a little bit more so we can mostly see a little bit more so we can mostly see a little bit more so we can mostly see this. Another thing that's going to make this. Another thing that's going to make this. Another thing that's going to make this scene look really awesome. this scene look really awesome. this scene look really awesome. Let me wait till I have a flat portion. Let me wait till I have a flat portion. Let me wait till I have a flat portion. There we go. Is click on the camera, There we go. Is click on the camera, There we go. Is click on the camera, go over here, go over here, go over here, and I'm going to go ahead and click on and I'm going to go ahead and click on and I'm going to go ahead and click on depth of field. Bring the f-stop down depth of field. Bring the f-stop down depth of field.

And uh we're exactly what you want. And uh we're done. Let me go ahead and just give this done. Let me go ahead and just give this done. Let me go ahead and just give this one render and see how this final output one render and see how this final output one render and see how this final output is going to look. So here we go. This is is going to look. So here we go. This is is going to look. So here we go. This is a the final output of this animation. It a the final output of this animation. It a the final output of this animation. It looks really awesome. It's really looks really awesome. It's really looks really awesome. It's really beautiful. You can have a lot of fun beautiful. You can have a lot of fun beautiful. You can have a lot of fun with it. Let me show you the export with it. Let me show you the export with it. Let me show you the export settings that I would recommend for this settings that I would recommend for this settings that I would recommend for this uh 1920 x 1080 or if you want it 4K, uh 1920 x 1080 or if you want it 4K, uh 1920 x 1080 or if you want it 4K, just type in 200. I would highly just type in 200. I would highly just type in 200. I would highly recommend a PNG sequence. Just make a recommend a PNG sequence. Just make a recommend a PNG sequence. Just make a folder, throw them in there, and then folder, throw them in there, and then folder, throw them in there, and then compile that. If you don't want to do compile that. If you don't want to do compile that. If you don't want to do that, you just want Blender to sped out that, you just want Blender to sped out that, you just want Blender to sped out a video. You don't want to compile PGs, a video. You don't want to compile PGs, a video. You don't want to compile PGs, you can go here to FFmpeg video, uh you can go here to FFmpeg video, uh you can go here to FFmpeg video, uh encoding to MP4 or QuickTime.

Um MP4 if you're on a PC. and then do perceptually on a PC. and then do perceptually on a PC. and then do perceptually lossless render render animation and lossless render render animation and lossless render render animation and when you're done you'll have something when you're done you'll have something when you're done you'll have something really cool like mine. So there you go. really cool like mine. So there you go. really cool like mine. So there you go. That is how you create this really cool That is how you create this really cool That is how you create this really cool topographic landscape inspired animation topographic landscape inspired animation topographic landscape inspired animation really whatever you want to call it.
