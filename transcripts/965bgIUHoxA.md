## Summary
In this blender tutorial we will be using geometry nodes to create light trails that draw geometry as the camera moves.

## Notes
In this blender tutorial we will be using geometry nodes to create light trails that draw geometry as the camera moves. This is a powerful concept that you can use in many of your motion graphics animations and other related styles of animationÔøº. We will be using geometry nodes to create the curves, creating a mirror system in geometry notes so that the animation will be a stainless loop. And will be using transparency to reveal the geometry as the camera moves.
