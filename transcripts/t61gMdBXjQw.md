how's it going guys so in today's how's it going guys so in today's how's it going guys so in today's tutorial we're going to be learning how tutorial we're going to be learning how tutorial we're going to be learning how to make this really cool kind of to make this really cool kind of to make this really cool kind of parasite effect it's using 100 geometry parasite effect it's using 100 geometry parasite effect it's using 100 geometry notes and it's really fun before we get notes and it's really fun before we get notes and it's really fun before we get into that all of my products are 25 off into that all of my products are 25 off into that all of my products are 25 off right now including real-time materials right now including real-time materials right now including real-time materials if you use the code ducky summer at if you use the code ducky summer at if you use the code ducky summer at checkout you will get 25 off on my checkout you will get 25 off on my checkout you will get 25 off on my shading course my animation course and shading course my animation course and shading course my animation course and of course real-time materials with that of course real-time materials with that of course real-time materials with that being said let's get into the tutorial being said let's get into the tutorial being said let's get into the tutorial all right so one thing that's very all right so one thing that's very all right so one thing that's very important for you to be able to follow important for you to be able to follow important for you to be able to follow along with this tutorial is you need to along with this tutorial is you need to along with this tutorial is you need to go ahead and Google blender daily builds go ahead and Google blender daily builds go ahead and Google blender daily builds or builder.blender.org and right here or builder.blender.org and right here or builder.blender.org and right here you're going to want to get the 3.3 beta you're going to want to get the 3.3 beta you're going to want to get the 3.3 beta as of recording this video right now as of recording this video right now as of recording this video right now blender 3.3 is in beta and if you're blender 3.3 is in beta and if you're blender 3.3 is in beta and if you're watching this several months watching this several months watching this several months um from today's date it might be in a um from today's date it might be in a um from today's date it might be in a stable build so you won't need to go to stable build so you won't need to go to stable build so you won't need to go to this you'll already be at 3.3 or 3.4 3.5 this you'll already be at 3.3 or 3.4 3.5 this you'll already be at 3.3 or 3.4 3.5 whatever but as of today you'll need to whatever but as of today you'll need to whatever but as of today you'll need to get this download that zip file unzip get this download that zip file unzip get this download that zip file unzip the file and open up the blender execute the file and open up the blender execute the file and open up the blender execute file uh with that being said once you file uh with that being said once you file uh with that being said once you open it up just go ahead and clear out open it up just go ahead and clear out open it up just go ahead and clear out your scene and then I'm going to be your scene and then I'm going to be your scene and then I'm going to be using Cycles to render this out so my using Cycles to render this out so my using Cycles to render this out so my Max bounces here in the light pads Max bounces here in the light pads Max bounces here in the light pads everything is set to one and reflective everything is set to one and reflective everything is set to one and reflective and refractive are completely off and and refractive are completely off and and refractive are completely off and then if you want to follow along in then if you want to follow along in then if you want to follow along in Eevee which you totally can Eevee which you totally can Eevee which you totally can um you go ahead and turn on Bloom um you go ahead and turn on Bloom um you go ahead and turn on Bloom ambient occlusion screen space ambient occlusion screen space ambient occlusion screen space Reflections and your motion blur but I'm Reflections and your motion blur but I'm Reflections and your motion blur but I'm not sure blur really works in this not sure blur really works in this not sure blur really works in this animation with that being said let's go animation with that being said let's go animation with that being said let's go back to Cycles or stay in that engine I back to Cycles or stay in that engine I back to Cycles or stay in that engine I am going going to go ahead and render at am going going to go ahead and render at am going going to go ahead and render at 800 samples all right so let's go ahead and get in a all right so let's go ahead and get in a all right so let's go ahead and get in a plan so shift a add in a plane that's plan so shift a add in a plane that's plan so shift a add in a plane that's the only real amount of geometry we're the only real amount of geometry we're the only real amount of geometry we're going to be goofing with this is going going to be goofing with this is going going to be goofing with this is going to be totally geometry nodes so click on to be totally geometry nodes so click on to be totally geometry nodes so click on your geometry nodes Tab and I'm going to your geometry nodes Tab and I'm going to your geometry nodes Tab and I'm going to go ahead and turn off this window I go ahead and turn off this window I go ahead and turn off this window I never use it never use it never use it um but let's go ahead and click new um but let's go ahead and click new um but let's go ahead and click new and then delete this input and then delete this input and then delete this input we don't really need that plane we're we don't really need that plane we're we don't really need that plane we're going to go ahead and go ahead and shift going to go ahead and go ahead and shift going to go ahead and go ahead and shift a search a search a search volume volume volume and then we're going to go here and get and then we're going to go here and get and then we're going to go here and get the volume Cube and that's going to go the volume Cube and that's going to go the volume Cube and that's going to go ahead and get us this some fog looks ahead and get us this some fog looks ahead and get us this some fog looks like you have a cube with a principled like you have a cube with a principled like you have a cube with a principled volume on it let's go ahead and type in volume on it let's go ahead and type in volume on it let's go ahead and type in volume again and get volume to mesh now volume again and get volume to mesh now volume again and get volume to mesh now we have kind of a beveled Cube we have kind of a beveled Cube we have kind of a beveled Cube so if you've never used the volume Cube so if you've never used the volume Cube so if you've never used the volume Cube before it's a fun little tool you can before it's a fun little tool you can before it's a fun little tool you can make this really cool volume Cube and make this really cool volume Cube and make this really cool volume Cube and it's there's not a lot to it to be it's there's not a lot to it to be it's there's not a lot to it to be honest and I have made a video on it in honest and I have made a video on it in honest and I have made a video on it in the past but really the most important the past but really the most important the past but really the most important thing to know in this tutorial for the thing to know in this tutorial for the thing to know in this tutorial for the volume cube is right over here is your volume cube is right over here is your volume cube is right over here is your resolution so if you click and drag it resolution so if you click and drag it resolution so if you click and drag it will up your resolution so now you just will up your resolution so now you just will up your resolution so now you just have massive amount of faces so if we go have massive amount of faces so if we go have massive amount of faces so if we go to the wireframe view you can see that to the wireframe view you can see that to the wireframe view you can see that if I click and drag and bring it back if I click and drag and bring it back if I click and drag and bring it back this is your subdivision for the cube so this is your subdivision for the cube so this is your subdivision for the cube so that's really important to note I'm that's really important to note I'm that's really important to note I'm going to keep mine at 50 for now but going to keep mine at 50 for now but going to keep mine at 50 for now but we're going to render it at 100. or we're going to render it at 100. or we're going to render it at 100. or really whenever your computer can handle really whenever your computer can handle really whenever your computer can handle sometimes you can't sometimes you can sometimes you can't sometimes you can sometimes you can't sometimes you can handle more handle more handle more now with that being said now with that being said now with that being said we want to turn this into a circle and we want to turn this into a circle and we want to turn this into a circle and there's no there's not a volume Circle there's no there's not a volume Circle there's no there's not a volume Circle there's not a volume Taurus there's just there's not a volume Taurus there's just there's not a volume Taurus there's just a volume Cube so what we need to do is a volume Cube so what we need to do is a volume Cube so what we need to do is get a gradient node get a gradient node get a gradient node gradient texture and go to spherical and gradient texture and go to spherical and gradient texture and go to spherical and that is just going to go ahead and turn that is just going to go ahead and turn that is just going to go ahead and turn it into a circle which is pretty neat it into a circle which is pretty neat it into a circle which is pretty neat very simple let's go ahead and smooth it very simple let's go ahead and smooth it very simple let's go ahead and smooth it out with a set shade smooth node that's out with a set shade smooth node that's out with a set shade smooth node that's all we're going to need to do that but all we're going to need to do that but all we're going to need to do that but now we need to take a noise texture and now we need to take a noise texture and now we need to take a noise texture and kind of destroy this but there's no real kind of destroy this but there's no real kind of destroy this but there's no real obvious way to do it because we're obvious way to do it because we're obvious way to do it because we're already using the input to destroy it already using the input to destroy it already using the input to destroy it typically you just put a noise texture typically you just put a noise texture typically you just put a noise texture in it and destroy the cube in it and destroy the cube in it and destroy the cube so this is what we have to do let's go so this is what we have to do let's go so this is what we have to do let's go ahead and get a mix RGB and we'll plug ahead and get a mix RGB and we'll plug ahead and get a mix RGB and we'll plug the gradient texture into the factor and the gradient texture into the factor and the gradient texture into the factor and then bring color one all the way to then bring color one all the way to then bring color one all the way to Black and that's going to give us our Black and that's going to give us our Black and that's going to give us our Circle back and we use this output right Circle back and we use this output right Circle back and we use this output right here to put textures into it here to put textures into it here to put textures into it the texture we're going to use is a the texture we're going to use is a the texture we're going to use is a noise texture but you can use any noise texture but you can use any noise texture but you can use any texture you want it's a really really texture you want it's a really really texture you want it's a really really fun to play with you can even pause the fun to play with you can even pause the fun to play with you can even pause the tutorial Now find a texture that you tutorial Now find a texture that you tutorial Now find a texture that you like and goof around with it our scale like and goof around with it our scale like and goof around with it our scale we're going to do 1.7 on the scale make we're going to do 1.7 on the scale make we're going to do 1.7 on the scale make sure it's 4D and that's so that we can sure it's 4D and that's so that we can sure it's 4D and that's so that we can animate it and then we need to go ahead animate it and then we need to go ahead animate it and then we need to go ahead and get a color ramp and get a color ramp and get a color ramp color ramp goes here and that's going to color ramp goes here and that's going to color ramp goes here and that's going to allow us to eat into this and so when we allow us to eat into this and so when we allow us to eat into this and so when we play with that W now we have the look play with that W now we have the look play with that W now we have the look that we're going for this used to be a that we're going for this used to be a that we're going for this used to be a lot more difficult you'd have to use lot more difficult you'd have to use lot more difficult you'd have to use like vertex groups and weirdness like vertex groups and weirdness like vertex groups and weirdness now with geometry notes it's just super now with geometry notes it's just super now with geometry notes it's just super easy to do so this is done we can Loop easy to do so this is done we can Loop easy to do so this is done we can Loop it but we'll go ahead and loop the it but we'll go ahead and loop the it but we'll go ahead and loop the animation later I want to go ahead and animation later I want to go ahead and animation later I want to go ahead and build kind of a cage around it now we're build kind of a cage around it now we're build kind of a cage around it now we're getting the point we can just kind of getting the point we can just kind of getting the point we can just kind of make this really cool looking make this really cool looking make this really cool looking um so we're gonna go ahead and get a um so we're gonna go ahead and get a um so we're gonna go ahead and get a join geometry node join geometry node join geometry node this is almost like a mixed Shader if this is almost like a mixed Shader if this is almost like a mixed Shader if you're familiar with nodes node-based you're familiar with nodes node-based you're familiar with nodes node-based shading shading shading the geometry nodes isn't going to be too the geometry nodes isn't going to be too the geometry nodes isn't going to be too crazy to understand especially if you're crazy to understand especially if you're crazy to understand especially if you're pretty good at node-based shading this pretty good at node-based shading this pretty good at node-based shading this is essentially a mix Shader what we need is essentially a mix Shader what we need is essentially a mix Shader what we need to do is get an icosphere to do is get an icosphere to do is get an icosphere put that over here and plug that put that over here and plug that put that over here and plug that straight into the joint geometry you straight into the joint geometry you straight into the joint geometry you just put it anywhere the uh the order just put it anywhere the uh the order just put it anywhere the uh the order doesn't matter if it's above or below doesn't matter if it's above or below doesn't matter if it's above or below them as far as I'm aware now let's go them as far as I'm aware now let's go them as far as I'm aware now let's go ahead and get in a mesh to curve that's ahead and get in a mesh to curve that's ahead and get in a mesh to curve that's going to turn this into kind of a going to turn this into kind of a going to turn this into kind of a wireframe and then I'm going to go ahead wireframe and then I'm going to go ahead wireframe and then I'm going to go ahead and bring my radius down a little bit I and bring my radius down a little bit I and bring my radius down a little bit I like the kind of parasite goo whatever like the kind of parasite goo whatever like the kind of parasite goo whatever to kind of intersect to kind of intersect to kind of intersect um the wireframe so it's kind of caged um the wireframe so it's kind of caged um the wireframe so it's kind of caged in but it's still trying to come out in but it's still trying to come out in but it's still trying to come out gives it a little bit of a story and now gives it a little bit of a story and now gives it a little bit of a story and now let's go ahead and get to curve to mesh let's go ahead and get to curve to mesh let's go ahead and get to curve to mesh curve to mesh put that there and to kind curve to mesh put that there and to kind curve to mesh put that there and to kind of initiate that we need to get a curved of initiate that we need to get a curved of initiate that we need to get a curved Circle Circle Circle so just type in circle and then the so just type in circle and then the so just type in circle and then the radius is going to dictate radius is going to dictate radius is going to dictate how big that bar is going to be so add how big that bar is going to be so add how big that bar is going to be so add the curve and then bring that radius the curve and then bring that radius the curve and then bring that radius down down down and now we have and now we have and now we have a bit of a cage that this is going to be a bit of a cage that this is going to be a bit of a cage that this is going to be encapsulated in but I also want to now encapsulated in but I also want to now encapsulated in but I also want to now add some spheres around each point the add some spheres around each point the add some spheres around each point the point is kind of the corners so using point is kind of the corners so using point is kind of the corners so using that word point we need to get an that word point we need to get an that word point we need to get an instance on point instance on point instance on point so we'll do a instance on points so we'll do a instance on points so we'll do a instance on points and we will plug the icosphere into the and we will plug the icosphere into the and we will plug the icosphere into the points selection so it says use these points selection so it says use these points selection so it says use these points and we're going to plug an object points and we're going to plug an object points and we're going to plug an object in the instance as what object we are in the instance as what object we are in the instance as what object we are going to instance so let's plug this going to instance so let's plug this going to instance so let's plug this into the genome geometry and let's get into the genome geometry and let's get into the genome geometry and let's get another icosphere all right here icosphere and plug that all right here icosphere and plug that all right here icosphere and plug that icosphere into the instance icosphere into the instance icosphere into the instance and then we're going to bring that and then we're going to bring that and then we're going to bring that radius down so now you can see it's on radius down so now you can see it's on radius down so now you can see it's on each point which is really really cool each point which is really really cool each point which is really really cool and then bring those subdivisions up a and then bring those subdivisions up a and then bring those subdivisions up a little bit on that icosphere you know little bit on that icosphere you know little bit on that icosphere you know really whatever you want really whatever you want really whatever you want um and we have it now you can see those um and we have it now you can see those um and we have it now you can see those faces let's go ahead and get that set faces let's go ahead and get that set faces let's go ahead and get that set shade smooth node I'm gonna hit shift d shade smooth node I'm gonna hit shift d shade smooth node I'm gonna hit shift d put it there put it there put it there perfectly smooth all right now we have perfectly smooth all right now we have perfectly smooth all right now we have this guy personally this guy personally this guy personally I think we should bring this maybe 0.02 I think we should bring this maybe 0.02 I think we should bring this maybe 0.02 that looks about right that looks really that looks about right that looks really that looks about right that looks really good maybe good maybe good maybe one five right in between those two all one five right in between those two all one five right in between those two all right cool perfect perfect perfect right cool perfect perfect perfect right cool perfect perfect perfect it looks awesome It looks interesting it looks awesome It looks interesting it looks awesome It looks interesting and we now have something really awesome and we now have something really awesome and we now have something really awesome now that we have this whole scene set up now that we have this whole scene set up now that we have this whole scene set up let's go ahead and loop the animation of let's go ahead and loop the animation of let's go ahead and loop the animation of this so let's go ahead hover over here this so let's go ahead hover over here this so let's go ahead hover over here you'll see a plus icon just drag that up you'll see a plus icon just drag that up you'll see a plus icon just drag that up and then we're gonna go to a timeline and then we're gonna go to a timeline and then we're gonna go to a timeline so go to your edit preferences here in so go to your edit preferences here in so go to your edit preferences here in the animation tab right here make sure the animation tab right here make sure the animation tab right here make sure your default interpolation is set to your default interpolation is set to your default interpolation is set to linear that's really important and I'm linear that's really important and I'm linear that's really important and I'm going to give myself 120 frames that's going to give myself 120 frames that's going to give myself 120 frames that's going to be about five seconds but this going to be about five seconds but this going to be about five seconds but this is going to be a seamless Loop so it can is going to be a seamless Loop so it can is going to be a seamless Loop so it can be infinite and it won't be obvious so be infinite and it won't be obvious so be infinite and it won't be obvious so let's go ahead and take this noise let's go ahead and take this noise let's go ahead and take this noise texture and make sure make sure your W texture and make sure make sure your W texture and make sure make sure your W is set to zero and if you don't have W is set to zero and if you don't have W is set to zero and if you don't have W right here you need to make sure that right here you need to make sure that right here you need to make sure that your node is 4D your node is 4D your node is 4D so let's go ahead and just hit shift d so let's go ahead and just hit shift d so let's go ahead and just hit shift d duplicate that get a mix RGB plug that duplicate that get a mix RGB plug that duplicate that get a mix RGB plug that there plug factor into color two make there plug factor into color two make there plug factor into color two make sure you're using Factor not color on sure you're using Factor not color on sure you're using Factor not color on both of these so let's go ahead and both of these so let's go ahead and both of these so let's go ahead and animate so right hover over your animate so right hover over your animate so right hover over your timeline hit the back arrow to go to timeline hit the back arrow to go to timeline hit the back arrow to go to frame zero hover over here and hit I frame zero hover over here and hit I frame zero hover over here and hit I and then go to the end and just slide and then go to the end and just slide and then go to the end and just slide that over and then hit I again that's that over and then hit I again that's that over and then hit I again that's going to give it a keyframe now if you going to give it a keyframe now if you going to give it a keyframe now if you click on it you can't see your keyframes click on it you can't see your keyframes click on it you can't see your keyframes that's normal I don't know why it does that's normal I don't know why it does that's normal I don't know why it does that but sometimes you just can't see that but sometimes you just can't see that but sometimes you just can't see your keyframes your keyframes your keyframes go back to frame zero right here on this go back to frame zero right here on this go back to frame zero right here on this w w w hit I go to the very end and type in one hit I go to the very end and type in one hit I go to the very end and type in one so that's going to make your W go to a so that's going to make your W go to a so that's going to make your W go to a value of one it's going to animate a value of one it's going to animate a value of one it's going to animate a little bit if you want your animation to little bit if you want your animation to little bit if you want your animation to go quicker use two three four five you go quicker use two three four five you go quicker use two three four five you know however strong you want it to be know however strong you want it to be know however strong you want it to be now that we're at the very end go to now that we're at the very end go to now that we're at the very end go to this one hover over the W make sure it's this one hover over the W make sure it's this one hover over the W make sure it's at zero hit I go to the end back to at zero hit I go to the end back to at zero hit I go to the end back to frame zero and since we use positive one frame zero and since we use positive one frame zero and since we use positive one on this one on this one on this one negative one at the very end negative one at the very end negative one at the very end oops oops oops delete keyframes there we go negative delete keyframes there we go negative delete keyframes there we go negative one so now we can see it animates if we one so now we can see it animates if we one so now we can see it animates if we go to the end it's a perfect Loop and go to the end it's a perfect Loop and go to the end it's a perfect Loop and again I mentioned if you want to be again I mentioned if you want to be again I mentioned if you want to be faster don't use a value of one using a faster don't use a value of one using a faster don't use a value of one using a value of two and then if you go to the value of two and then if you go to the value of two and then if you go to the very end make sure this one is negative very end make sure this one is negative very end make sure this one is negative two so they relate two so they relate two so they relate but with that being said we now have but with that being said we now have but with that being said we now have this and if you want to know like what this and if you want to know like what this and if you want to know like what would this look like for res would this look like for res would this look like for res go here to this node go here to this node go here to this node a hundred it looks really cool and very a hundred it looks really cool and very a hundred it looks really cool and very goopy and strange but we now are done goopy and strange but we now are done goopy and strange but we now are done modeling we're done with the modeling modeling we're done with the modeling modeling we're done with the modeling section and animation section section and animation section section and animation section we're pretty much done but I always like we're pretty much done but I always like we're pretty much done but I always like to leave you guys with something you can to leave you guys with something you can to leave you guys with something you can walk away with have something you can walk away with have something you can walk away with have something you can post show whatever so let's build an post show whatever so let's build an post show whatever so let's build an environment around a very simple one environment around a very simple one environment around a very simple one so I'm gonna hit the tilde key which is so I'm gonna hit the tilde key which is so I'm gonna hit the tilde key which is right above the Tab Key I'm going to right above the Tab Key I'm going to right above the Tab Key I'm going to click front click front click front shift a add a camera and I'm going to shift a add a camera and I'm going to shift a add a camera and I'm going to hit Ctrl alt 0 that's going to snap that hit Ctrl alt 0 that's going to snap that hit Ctrl alt 0 that's going to snap that camera to view and say it's like way out camera to view and say it's like way out camera to view and say it's like way out here or way in here just hit G and here or way in here just hit G and here or way in here just hit G and middle click and that'll slide it out middle click and that'll slide it out middle click and that'll slide it out to where you want it to be there we go to where you want it to be there we go to where you want it to be there we go look how cool that looks look how cool that looks look how cool that looks so let's go ahead and build a scene so let's go ahead and build a scene so let's go ahead and build a scene around this so I'm going to be using around this so I'm going to be using around this so I'm going to be using Cycles you don't have to use Cycles you Cycles you don't have to use Cycles you Cycles you don't have to use Cycles you can use EV just really depends on your can use EV just really depends on your can use EV just really depends on your preference and your Hardware preference and your Hardware preference and your Hardware so here in the world icon I'm going to so here in the world icon I'm going to so here in the world icon I'm going to go ahead and bring it all the way down go ahead and bring it all the way down go ahead and bring it all the way down to Black to Black to Black and then I want to have a light that's and then I want to have a light that's and then I want to have a light that's really big and behind this so you get a really big and behind this so you get a really big and behind this so you get a really soft lighting and you also get really soft lighting and you also get really soft lighting and you also get some silhouette so I'll go ahead and get some silhouette so I'll go ahead and get some silhouette so I'll go ahead and get a point light and I'm going to hit G and a point light and I'm going to hit G and a point light and I'm going to hit G and I'm going to move it I'm going to move it I'm going to move it here so it's behind and it's up here so it's behind and it's up here so it's behind and it's up so it really does not to be need to be so it really does not to be need to be so it really does not to be need to be an exact science so we're going to go an exact science so we're going to go an exact science so we're going to go now here to the Cycles view I'm going to now here to the Cycles view I'm going to now here to the Cycles view I'm going to give my power at 10 000. give my power at 10 000. give my power at 10 000. and that you might say oh that's way too and that you might say oh that's way too and that you might say oh that's way too bright and that's because we're going to bright and that's because we're going to bright and that's because we're going to bring this radius bring this radius bring this radius really high up so now it's super soft really high up so now it's super soft really high up so now it's super soft um now that we're here let's go ahead um now that we're here let's go ahead um now that we're here let's go ahead and add the volume so go to the World and add the volume so go to the World and add the volume so go to the World Properties volume right here in volume Properties volume right here in volume Properties volume right here in volume go to principled volume go to principled volume go to principled volume now it's going to take everything away now it's going to take everything away now it's going to take everything away right here in your density 0.01 right here in your density 0.01 right here in your density 0.01 on the point light setting so click on on the point light setting so click on on the point light setting so click on your point light go to the settings make your point light go to the settings make your point light go to the settings make it whatever color you want I love a it whatever color you want I love a it whatever color you want I love a slight blue now we're here let's go slight blue now we're here let's go slight blue now we're here let's go ahead and add materials to this ahead and add materials to this ahead and add materials to this in Geometry nodes it's a little bit in Geometry nodes it's a little bit in Geometry nodes it's a little bit weirder to make to add materials you weirder to make to add materials you weirder to make to add materials you can't just add them the typical can't just add them the typical can't just add them the typical traditional way traditional way traditional way so go here to this join geometry each of so go here to this join geometry each of so go here to this join geometry each of these strings represents a piece of this these strings represents a piece of this these strings represents a piece of this pie in a sense so this string is the goo pie in a sense so this string is the goo pie in a sense so this string is the goo this string here would be the wireframe this string here would be the wireframe this string here would be the wireframe and this string here would be those and this string here would be those and this string here would be those spheres on each point so we need to add spheres on each point so we need to add spheres on each point so we need to add a set material node a set material node a set material node so set material and then shift d so set material and then shift d so set material and then shift d plop them on each side now we need two plop them on each side now we need two plop them on each side now we need two materials we need the goo that's a materials we need the goo that's a materials we need the goo that's a glowing goo and the kind of basic glowing goo and the kind of basic glowing goo and the kind of basic material so right over here click this material so right over here click this material so right over here click this click new I'm going to call it click new I'm going to call it click new I'm going to call it goo goo goo I'll click another one and we're going I'll click another one and we're going I'll click another one and we're going to call it base to call it base to call it base the reason why we're titling them is the reason why we're titling them is the reason why we're titling them is over here you have to be able to see over here you have to be able to see over here you have to be able to see them so it's more important to tile them them so it's more important to tile them them so it's more important to tile them I used to never need to dial them let me I used to never need to dial them let me I used to never need to dial them let me title them with that being said let's go title them with that being said let's go title them with that being said let's go ahead and click goo here ahead and click goo here ahead and click goo here base base base base now let's go here to the shading base now let's go here to the shading base now let's go here to the shading Tab and work on texturing these guys Tab and work on texturing these guys Tab and work on texturing these guys shading them whatever term you like to shading them whatever term you like to shading them whatever term you like to use use use so we on slot two which is the base keep so we on slot two which is the base keep so we on slot two which is the base keep that in mind slot one is the goo slot that in mind slot one is the goo slot that in mind slot one is the goo slot two is the base uh so base color bring two is the base uh so base color bring two is the base uh so base color bring that to Black and bring your roughness that to Black and bring your roughness that to Black and bring your roughness almost all the way down now we have this almost all the way down now we have this almost all the way down now we have this beautiful shiny black material now let's beautiful shiny black material now let's beautiful shiny black material now let's go here to slot number one which is goo go here to slot number one which is goo go here to slot number one which is goo we're gonna do the same thing we're gonna do the same thing we're gonna do the same thing really low roughness bring that specular really low roughness bring that specular really low roughness bring that specular all the way up so you get really bright all the way up so you get really bright all the way up so you get really bright Reflections you can even go up to like Reflections you can even go up to like Reflections you can even go up to like two really bright Reflections you can two really bright Reflections you can two really bright Reflections you can really force it uh with those values and really force it uh with those values and really force it uh with those values and then here we need to go add some then here we need to go add some then here we need to go add some emission so let's get a color ramp emission so let's get a color ramp emission so let's get a color ramp and we want a smooth gradient so we're and we want a smooth gradient so we're and we want a smooth gradient so we're going to go to B spline and we need a going to go to B spline and we need a going to go to B spline and we need a layer weight layer weight layer weight layer weight and use the facing layer weight and use the facing layer weight and use the facing and then plug the color into the and then plug the color into the and then plug the color into the emission emission emission so now when we play with this blend it's so now when we play with this blend it's so now when we play with this blend it's going to go back to the edge let's go going to go back to the edge let's go going to go back to the edge let's go ahead and bring this color ramp in so ahead and bring this color ramp in so ahead and bring this color ramp in so now we get this effect now we get this effect now we get this effect the white go ahead and add whatever the white go ahead and add whatever the white go ahead and add whatever color you want I'm gonna go with green color you want I'm gonna go with green color you want I'm gonna go with green because it's very sci-fi and because it's very sci-fi and because it's very sci-fi and you guys know I love the Sci-Fi Styles you guys know I love the Sci-Fi Styles you guys know I love the Sci-Fi Styles I'm going to go ahead and just remove I'm going to go ahead and just remove I'm going to go ahead and just remove this background it's just preference and this background it's just preference and this background it's just preference and then bring that up that emission then bring that up that emission then bring that up that emission strength and you're going to have strength and you're going to have strength and you're going to have something crazy I'm gonna go to Cycles something crazy I'm gonna go to Cycles something crazy I'm gonna go to Cycles and tweak this a little bit and tweak this a little bit and tweak this a little bit something like this something like this something like this bring that emission strength really high bring that emission strength really high bring that emission strength really high we want to be able to Glow really nicely we want to be able to Glow really nicely we want to be able to Glow really nicely there we go we have this looks awesome there we go we have this looks awesome there we go we have this looks awesome looks clean looks nice and our light is looks clean looks nice and our light is looks clean looks nice and our light is too bright it's because of our uh too bright it's because of our uh too bright it's because of our uh specular so we can bring that specular specular so we can bring that specular specular so we can bring that specular back to one bring your specular down it back to one bring your specular down it back to one bring your specular down it really just depends on how you want really just depends on how you want really just depends on how you want that to look let's bring that specular that to look let's bring that specular that to look let's bring that specular back to two and bring our light down back to two and bring our light down back to two and bring our light down might be too bright so let's go five might be too bright so let's go five might be too bright so let's go five thousand thousand thousand there we go that looks really nice and there we go that looks really nice and there we go that looks really nice and it'll still be able to glow and we can it'll still be able to glow and we can it'll still be able to glow and we can bring that radius higher which is bring that radius higher which is bring that radius higher which is exactly what we should have been doing exactly what we should have been doing exactly what we should have been doing originally originally originally so we can capitalize on these so we can capitalize on these so we can capitalize on these reflections reflections reflections possibly bring that light back a little possibly bring that light back a little possibly bring that light back a little bit not sure what good that's gonna do bit not sure what good that's gonna do bit not sure what good that's gonna do but I'm going to hit G and move it back this is just kind of messing around this is just kind of messing around this is just kind of messing around preference here preference here preference here maybe eight thousand maybe eight thousand maybe eight thousand cool so now we have these Reflections cool so now we have these Reflections cool so now we have these Reflections bring that bring that bring that higher now we're just goofing around higher now we're just goofing around higher now we're just goofing around what are we doing cool cool cool all right it's good enough and then if all right it's good enough and then if all right it's good enough and then if we press play we get these nice we press play we get these nice we press play we get these nice Reflections I would tweak it farther Reflections I would tweak it farther Reflections I would tweak it farther I would edit it farther to make it look I would edit it farther to make it look I would edit it farther to make it look cool but for the sake of the tutorial cool but for the sake of the tutorial cool but for the sake of the tutorial this is how it looks maybe bring some this is how it looks maybe bring some this is how it looks maybe bring some roughness in roughness in roughness in oh yeah there we go now that looks even oh yeah there we go now that looks even oh yeah there we go now that looks even better just a softer Edge which is better just a softer Edge which is better just a softer Edge which is something we like all right now something we like all right now something we like all right now um we're done we're pretty much done um we're done we're pretty much done um we're done we're pretty much done with the tutorial with the tutorial with the tutorial let me show you guys how to export this let me show you guys how to export this let me show you guys how to export this and we will be done so click on the and we will be done so click on the and we will be done so click on the printer icon go ahead and select your printer icon go ahead and select your printer icon go ahead and select your resolution I love to just keep it at resolution I love to just keep it at resolution I love to just keep it at default 1920. if you're a big fan of 4K default 1920. if you're a big fan of 4K default 1920. if you're a big fan of 4K just type in 200 on that value and just type in 200 on that value and just type in 200 on that value and that'll make it 4K that'll make it 4K that'll make it 4K um frame frame rate's fine go ahead and um frame frame rate's fine go ahead and um frame frame rate's fine go ahead and make a new file on your desktop or make a new file on your desktop or make a new file on your desktop or wherever and click this plus icon and wherever and click this plus icon and wherever and click this plus icon and I'm going to call this I'm going to call this I'm going to call this and then double click it and accept and then double click it and accept and then double click it and accept that's going to save all your pngs that's going to save all your pngs that's going to save all your pngs um I would highly recommend doing a PNG um I would highly recommend doing a PNG um I would highly recommend doing a PNG sequence and then just go ahead and sequence and then just go ahead and sequence and then just go ahead and render render render render animation and you'll be done now render animation and you'll be done now render animation and you'll be done now if you just want blender to compile a if you just want blender to compile a if you just want blender to compile a video for you you don't have to compile video for you you don't have to compile video for you you don't have to compile the PNG sequences especially if you're the PNG sequences especially if you're the PNG sequences especially if you're using Eevee it probably won't crash go using Eevee it probably won't crash go using Eevee it probably won't crash go from PNG to ffmpeg video encoding go from PNG to ffmpeg video encoding go from PNG to ffmpeg video encoding go here to MP4 and output quality here to MP4 and output quality here to MP4 and output quality perceptually lossless render render perceptually lossless render render perceptually lossless render render animation animation animation and you'll be done uh but with that and you'll be done uh but with that and you'll be done uh but with that being said that is how you create that being said that is how you create that being said that is how you create that animation I hope you learned some stuff animation I hope you learned some stuff animation I hope you learned some stuff again all of my products are 25 off for again all of my products are 25 off for again all of my products are 25 off for the rest of the week if you want
