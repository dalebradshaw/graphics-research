How's it going? So, in this tutorial, we How's it going? So, in this tutorial, we How's it going? So, in this tutorial, we are going to be making this animation are going to be making this animation are going to be making this animation right here. We're first going to be right here. We're first going to be right here. We're first going to be taking a black and white image and we're taking a black and white image and we're taking a black and white image and we're going to be using that as the way to going to be using that as the way to going to be using that as the way to create the text in our animation. First, create the text in our animation. First, create the text in our animation. First, we're going to take a grid and duplicate we're going to take a grid and duplicate we're going to take a grid and duplicate points within that grid. Then, use that points within that grid. Then, use that points within that grid. Then, use that image as the way to delete the points image as the way to delete the points image as the way to delete the points when they are in the space of the text. when they are in the space of the text. when they are in the space of the text. After that, we'll do some simple After that, we'll do some simple After that, we'll do some simple displacement to animate all of those displacement to animate all of those displacement to animate all of those points and use that same displacement to points and use that same displacement to points and use that same displacement to provide color within those points. Then provide color within those points. Then provide color within those points. Then we just need some simple lighting. we just need some simple lighting. we just need some simple lighting. Animate the movement with a loop and Animate the movement with a loop and Animate the movement with a loop and we'll be done. If you want to learn more we'll be done. If you want to learn more we'll be done. If you want to learn more about particle systems and how to make about particle systems and how to make about particle systems and how to make them look cooler, light them, animate them look cooler, light them, animate them look cooler, light them, animate them, a lot of different ways to control them, a lot of different ways to control them, a lot of different ways to control your particle systems within Geometry your particle systems within Geometry your particle systems within Geometry Nodes, I just launched an entire series Nodes, I just launched an entire series Nodes, I just launched an entire series on my Patreon dedicated to that theme. on my Patreon dedicated to that theme. on my Patreon dedicated to that theme. So, if you want to learn more about So, if you want to learn more about So, if you want to learn more about that, check out my Patreon in the that, check out my Patreon in the that, check out my Patreon in the description along with all the other description along with all the other description along with all the other content that I have on there.

And you can get a discount if you subscribe can get a discount if you subscribe can get a discount if you subscribe annually. With that being said, let's annually. With that being said, let's annually. With that being said, let's get into this tutorial. All right, we get into this tutorial. All right, we get into this tutorial. All right, we are going to be using this image as the are going to be using this image as the are going to be using this image as the mask in our animation. If you don't have mask in our animation. If you don't have mask in our animation. If you don't have your own black and white image, you can your own black and white image, you can your own black and white image, you can quite literally use any black and white quite literally use any black and white quite literally use any black and white image you want. Um, on Patreon right image you want. Um, on Patreon right image you want. Um, on Patreon right now, you can actually grab the now, you can actually grab the now, you can actually grab the attachment for free. You don't need a attachment for free. You don't need a attachment for free. You don't need a Patreon account. I'll link in the Patreon account. I'll link in the Patreon account. I'll link in the description. Just download the description. Just download the description. Just download the attachment and you can get this or attachment and you can get this or attachment and you can get this or again, use any black and white image as again, use any black and white image as again, use any black and white image as your mask and it does not need to be your mask and it does not need to be your mask and it does not need to be this aspect ratio. So, just have some this aspect ratio. So, just have some this aspect ratio. So, just have some type of mask image that you want to use type of mask image that you want to use type of mask image that you want to use as the shape within your particle as the shape within your particle as the shape within your particle system. Now, let's go ahead here in system. Now, let's go ahead here in system. Now, let's go ahead here in Blender. I'm going to open up a brand Blender. I'm going to open up a brand Blender. I'm going to open up a brand new window. I'm going go ahead and get a new window. I'm going go ahead and get a new window. I'm going go ahead and get a plane. And up here, we're going to get a plane. And up here, we're going to get a plane. And up here, we're going to get a geometry nodes editor and click new. So, geometry nodes editor and click new. So, geometry nodes editor and click new. So, first let's go ahead and get a cube. So, first let's go ahead and get a cube. So, first let's go ahead and get a cube. So, we'll go ahead cube be cube. Plug him we'll go ahead cube be cube. Plug him we'll go ahead cube be cube. Plug him here. And let's go ahead and stretch him here. And let's go ahead and stretch him here. And let's go ahead and stretch him to be uh to fill the space that we want to be uh to fill the space that we want to be uh to fill the space that we want to have our text occupy. Something to have our text occupy. Something to have our text occupy. Something around these lines. It really does not around these lines. It really does not around these lines. It really does not need to be exact. And just about how need to be exact. And just about how need to be exact. And just about how thick you want those particles to be as thick you want those particles to be as thick you want those particles to be as well. Something like this. Now, what we well. Something like this. Now, what we well. Something like this. Now, what we can do is convert this thing to a can do is convert this thing to a can do is convert this thing to a volume. So, mesh to volume, volume. So, mesh to volume, volume. So, mesh to volume, just like that. And then you can bring just like that. And then you can bring just like that. And then you can bring up that density. You can bring up that up that density. You can bring up that up that density. You can bring up that voxil amount. H, which is really isn't voxil amount. H, which is really isn't voxil amount. H, which is really isn't that important. And then you can bring that important. And then you can bring that important. And then you can bring up that density to make sure that the up that density to make sure that the up that density to make sure that the volume is the same size as our cube. Now volume is the same size as our cube. Now volume is the same size as our cube. Now what we can do is do a distribute points what we can do is do a distribute points what we can do is do a distribute points in volume. So distribute points in in volume. So distribute points in in volume. So distribute points in volume node. And then you could start to volume node. And then you could start to volume node. And then you could start to bring up that density pretty quick. And bring up that density pretty quick. And bring up that density pretty quick. And now we have a field of randomly placed now we have a field of randomly placed now we have a field of randomly placed uh particles. So what I want to do now uh particles. So what I want to do now uh particles. So what I want to do now is I'm hit shift A and get a plane. And is I'm hit shift A and get a plane. And is I'm hit shift A and get a plane. And I just want this plane uh to be the I just want this plane uh to be the I just want this plane uh to be the floor that is going to we can see uh floor that is going to we can see uh floor that is going to we can see uh through the text. And so we can just through the text. And so we can just through the text. And so we can just bring that grid bring that grid bring that grid right at the very bottom of the right at the very bottom of the right at the very bottom of the particles. So if you go here to cycles, particles. So if you go here to cycles, particles. So if you go here to cycles, you'll be able to see particles and a you'll be able to see particles and a you'll be able to see particles and a floor. And it's cool and it's great. And floor. And it's cool and it's great. And floor. And it's cool and it's great. And you can actually hit this drop down up you can actually hit this drop down up you can actually hit this drop down up here and click scene world scene lights. here and click scene world scene lights. here and click scene world scene lights. And you don't have to add lighting right And you don't have to add lighting right And you don't have to add lighting right now to be able to kind of see this and now to be able to kind of see this and now to be able to kind of see this and appreciate it. Now that we've created appreciate it. Now that we've created appreciate it. Now that we've created our particles, let's go ahead and use our particles, let's go ahead and use our particles, let's go ahead and use our image to delete the particles that our image to delete the particles that our image to delete the particles that are going to take up the space of the are going to take up the space of the are going to take up the space of the text. So, what we're going to do is get text. So, what we're going to do is get text. So, what we're going to do is get a a a delete geometry node. Make sure it says delete geometry node. Make sure it says delete geometry node. Make sure it says points, but that's default, so it should points, but that's default, so it should points, but that's default, so it should say it. We're going to get a image say it. We're going to get a image say it. We're going to get a image texture. texture. texture. Plug this right here into selection and Plug this right here into selection and Plug this right here into selection and go here and open up your image. So now go here and open up your image. So now go here and open up your image. So now if you see some weird things happening, if you see some weird things happening, if you see some weird things happening, just know that means uh your image is just know that means uh your image is just know that means uh your image is working. You can see it kind of getting working. You can see it kind of getting working. You can see it kind of getting tile uh tiled all over here. So right tile uh tiled all over here. So right tile uh tiled all over here. So right over here, go from repeat to clip. And over here, go from repeat to clip. And over here, go from repeat to clip. And then we're going to get a couple nodes. then we're going to get a couple nodes. then we're going to get a couple nodes. You can kind of see it happening right You can kind of see it happening right You can kind of see it happening right there. Um so that's where my image is there. Um so that's where my image is there. Um so that's where my image is existing. It's too small. It's just not existing. It's too small. It's just not existing. It's too small. It's just not what we want. So what I'm going to do is what we want. So what I'm going to do is what we want. So what I'm going to do is to get a position node. And what we're to get a position node. And what we're to get a position node. And what we're going to create is a texture coordinate. going to create is a texture coordinate. going to create is a texture coordinate. um they we don't have a texture um they we don't have a texture um they we don't have a texture coordinate uh in the same exact way that coordinate uh in the same exact way that coordinate uh in the same exact way that we do in um in the shading workspace. So we do in um in the shading workspace. So we do in um in the shading workspace. So we can build it though. So position just we can build it though. So position just we can build it though. So position just is important to know. Hey, there's space is important to know. Hey, there's space is important to know. Hey, there's space here. So we're going to get in a here. So we're going to get in a here. So we're going to get in a vector math node. He is going to vector math node. He is going to vector math node. He is going to represent position. So we'll plug him represent position. So we'll plug him represent position. So we'll plug him there. Just the add. And then we're there. Just the add. And then we're there. Just the add. And then we're going to go ahead and get in uh going to go ahead and get in uh going to go ahead and get in uh duplicate him. Switch him over to duplicate him. Switch him over to duplicate him. Switch him over to multiply. He is going to represent the multiply. He is going to represent the multiply. He is going to represent the scale function in a texture coordinate. scale function in a texture coordinate. scale function in a texture coordinate. and you can plug it there. So now bring and you can plug it there. So now bring and you can plug it there. So now bring your multiply back to one. In fact, if your multiply back to one. In fact, if your multiply back to one. In fact, if you just bring it up like that, you will you just bring it up like that, you will you just bring it up like that, you will start to see it happening. And because start to see it happening. And because start to see it happening. And because this is like a scale, it also means you this is like a scale, it also means you this is like a scale, it also means you can stretch and squash. Now this is your can stretch and squash. Now this is your can stretch and squash. Now this is your position. So you can bring and center position. So you can bring and center position. So you can bring and center out this thing. Of course, right now we out this thing. Of course, right now we out this thing. Of course, right now we just need to actually scale it up. Um so just need to actually scale it up. Um so just need to actually scale it up. Um so it will start to stretch around um in a it will start to stretch around um in a it will start to stretch around um in a way that you don't want as you're way that you don't want as you're way that you don't want as you're playing around with it. So it is just playing around with it. So it is just playing around with it. So it is just going to uh it's going to be a matter of going to uh it's going to be a matter of going to uh it's going to be a matter of just massaging this image until it takes just massaging this image until it takes just massaging this image until it takes the form however you want it to. So the form however you want it to. So the form however you want it to. So something like something like something like this. There are some more sort of this. There are some more sort of this. There are some more sort of intricate ways to actually get it to intricate ways to actually get it to intricate ways to actually get it to perfectly map. Um I'm not really I'm not perfectly map. Um I'm not really I'm not perfectly map. Um I'm not really I'm not going to be that exact about it. So now going to be that exact about it. So now going to be that exact about it. So now we have an image that deletes objects. we have an image that deletes objects. we have an image that deletes objects. We can see look at that. It works. Now We can see look at that. It works. Now We can see look at that. It works. Now the next thing I want to do is use the next thing I want to do is use the next thing I want to do is use displacement to animate all these displacement to animate all these displacement to animate all these particles. And that's where hierarchy is particles. And that's where hierarchy is particles. And that's where hierarchy is going to be very important. If we add going to be very important. If we add going to be very important. If we add our displacement here, which let's just our displacement here, which let's just our displacement here, which let's just go ahead and I'm going to show you go ahead and I'm going to show you go ahead and I'm going to show you what'll happen. If I do this, and then I what'll happen. If I do this, and then I what'll happen. If I do this, and then I add my noise texture to my set position add my noise texture to my set position add my noise texture to my set position node and I click normalize and add node and I click normalize and add node and I click normalize and add color. color. color. Where' our text go? Right, that's Where' our text go? Right, that's Where' our text go? Right, that's because the action is happening after because the action is happening after because the action is happening after the formation of the text. We need to the formation of the text. We need to the formation of the text. We need to displace our particles before the displace our particles before the displace our particles before the formation of the text, before the formation of the text, before the formation of the text, before the function of the deleting. And so what we function of the deleting. And so what we function of the deleting. And so what we need to do instead of putting set need to do instead of putting set need to do instead of putting set position after, put it before. And that position after, put it before. And that position after, put it before. And that is going to be the only thing we need to is going to be the only thing we need to is going to be the only thing we need to do. So just go ahead, get a set position do. So just go ahead, get a set position do. So just go ahead, get a set position node, go and get in a noise texture. And node, go and get in a noise texture. And node, go and get in a noise texture. And we're going to plug color right into we're going to plug color right into we're going to plug color right into offset. And notice, bring that detail offset. And notice, bring that detail offset. And notice, bring that detail down. Bring that scale up. No matter down. Bring that scale up. No matter down. Bring that scale up. No matter what we do and switch this over to 4D, what we do and switch this over to 4D, what we do and switch this over to 4D, that text is staying put. And that is that text is staying put. And that is that text is staying put. And that is exactly what we want. I'm going to go exactly what we want. I'm going to go exactly what we want. I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to bring up the ahead and I'm going to bring up the ahead and I'm going to bring up the scale of my uh scale of my uh scale of my uh box just because I know um it's going to box just because I know um it's going to box just because I know um it's going to be moving around quite a bit. So I'm be moving around quite a bit. So I'm be moving around quite a bit. So I'm going to go ahead here to the top. I'm going to go ahead here to the top. I'm going to go ahead here to the top. I'm hit shift A. Get a camera control alt0 hit shift A. Get a camera control alt0 hit shift A. Get a camera control alt0 and snap it to view. and snap it to view. and snap it to view. And I want my And I want my And I want my text to be like this. So now I know, text to be like this. So now I know, text to be like this. So now I know, hey, the text needs to be centered out a hey, the text needs to be centered out a hey, the text needs to be centered out a little bit. So, we'll go back to our little bit. So, we'll go back to our little bit. So, we'll go back to our mapping nodes and say, "Hey, mapping nodes and say, "Hey, mapping nodes and say, "Hey, stay in the middle." All right. Next is stay in the middle." All right. Next is stay in the middle." All right. Next is the scale of our points. They're kind of the scale of our points. They're kind of the scale of our points. They're kind of big. Um, particle systems, at least ones big. Um, particle systems, at least ones big. Um, particle systems, at least ones like this, they tend to look better at like this, they tend to look better at like this, they tend to look better at higher volumes and smaller scales. This higher volumes and smaller scales. This higher volumes and smaller scales. This is just kind of glob and ugly. And so, is just kind of glob and ugly. And so, is just kind of glob and ugly. And so, what we can do is get a set what we can do is get a set what we can do is get a set point radius. And then you can start to point radius. And then you can start to point radius. And then you can start to bring that down to maybe 0.02. bring that down to maybe 0.02. bring that down to maybe 0.02. There we go. Very small. Which means There we go. Very small. Which means There we go. Very small. Which means we just need to bring up the density we just need to bring up the density we just need to bring up the density of our displacement. Now, here's one of our displacement. Now, here's one of our displacement. Now, here's one thing that I want to change. Notice the thing that I want to change. Notice the thing that I want to change. Notice the uh displacement is going to be on X, Y, uh displacement is going to be on X, Y, uh displacement is going to be on X, Y, and the Z in terms of our uh set and the Z in terms of our uh set and the Z in terms of our uh set position. I don't want that. I only want position. I don't want that. I only want position. I don't want that. I only want the displacement to happen this way. I the displacement to happen this way. I the displacement to happen this way. I don't want it to happen that way. I want don't want it to happen that way. I want don't want it to happen that way. I want it to be perfectly flat. So, what we can it to be perfectly flat. So, what we can it to be perfectly flat. So, what we can do here on the noise texture, make sure do here on the noise texture, make sure do here on the noise texture, make sure you are unchecking normalize. And then you are unchecking normalize. And then you are unchecking normalize. And then what we need to do is get a vector math what we need to do is get a vector math what we need to do is get a vector math node. Set that to a multiply. And what node. Set that to a multiply. And what node. Set that to a multiply. And what that's going to let us do is actually that's going to let us do is actually that's going to let us do is actually not only play with the strength of the not only play with the strength of the not only play with the strength of the displacement that we're giving it, which displacement that we're giving it, which displacement that we're giving it, which will automatically make it really more will automatically make it really more will automatically make it really more wiggly and more interesting and just a wiggly and more interesting and just a wiggly and more interesting and just a little bit more fun to look at, but also little bit more fun to look at, but also little bit more fun to look at, but also is going to say, "Hey, don't don't is going to say, "Hey, don't don't is going to say, "Hey, don't don't displace it that way. Keep it on the displace it that way. Keep it on the displace it that way. Keep it on the flat." Cuz that's going to help with the flat." Cuz that's going to help with the flat." Cuz that's going to help with the effect that we're going for. And also effect that we're going for. And also effect that we're going for. And also just lets us play with it on the X and just lets us play with it on the X and just lets us play with it on the X and the Y. And then when we animate it, it the Y. And then when we animate it, it the Y. And then when we animate it, it will look really, really cool. So now we will look really, really cool. So now we will look really, really cool. So now we have this. You can play with uh the have this. You can play with uh the have this. You can play with uh the radius of your objects if you want a radius of your objects if you want a radius of your objects if you want a little bit more. To me, it's going to be little bit more. To me, it's going to be little bit more. To me, it's going to be at a higher density. So what are we at? at a higher density. So what are we at? at a higher density. So what are we at? 180. Let's do like 600. 180. Let's do like 600. 180. Let's do like 600. So that looks cool. Now, it's not going So that looks cool. Now, it's not going So that looks cool. Now, it's not going to look quite as obvious until we start to look quite as obvious until we start to look quite as obvious until we start adding colors. So, let's go ahead and adding colors. So, let's go ahead and adding colors. So, let's go ahead and start to add some shading to this. But I start to add some shading to this. But I start to add some shading to this. But I want this noise texture to influence the want this noise texture to influence the want this noise texture to influence the colors that we're going to see on our colors that we're going to see on our colors that we're going to see on our particles. So, what we can do is right particles. So, what we can do is right particles. So, what we can do is right after the set point radius, get a set after the set point radius, get a set after the set point radius, get a set material node right over here, we can material node right over here, we can material node right over here, we can just go ahead and click new. He's just just go ahead and click new. He's just just go ahead and click new. He's just called 001. We'll go ahead and grab 001. called 001. We'll go ahead and grab 001. called 001. We'll go ahead and grab 001. And then we can get a And then we can get a And then we can get a we can hit shift A and get a store named we can hit shift A and get a store named we can hit shift A and get a store named attribute. I'm going to say C for color. attribute. I'm going to say C for color. attribute. I'm going to say C for color. Everything's lagging a little bit, so Everything's lagging a little bit, so Everything's lagging a little bit, so I'm just going to bring my density down I'm just going to bring my density down I'm just going to bring my density down to like 300 for now. to like 300 for now. to like 300 for now. And then we can just go ahead and take And then we can just go ahead and take And then we can just go ahead and take this color, plug it right into value. this color, plug it right into value. this color, plug it right into value. And now we have that. And we can switch And now we have that. And we can switch And now we have that. And we can switch this guy over to the shader editor. I'm this guy over to the shader editor. I'm this guy over to the shader editor. I'm going to go back here to the view. Let's going to go back here to the view. Let's going to go back here to the view. Let's go ahead and grab that attribute. So, we go ahead and grab that attribute. So, we go ahead and grab that attribute. So, we got attribute right here, C for color, got attribute right here, C for color, got attribute right here, C for color, and let's plug color right into color. and let's plug color right into color. and let's plug color right into color. So, now we have this. So, now let's go So, now we have this. So, now let's go So, now we have this. So, now let's go ahead and get a color ramp and select uh ahead and get a color ramp and select uh ahead and get a color ramp and select uh some really cool colors. So, we're going some really cool colors. So, we're going some really cool colors. So, we're going to go ahead get this a color ramp. And a to go ahead get this a color ramp. And a to go ahead get this a color ramp. And a fun little trick is I'm going to go fun little trick is I'm going to go fun little trick is I'm going to go switch this over to a HSV, switch this switch this over to a HSV, switch this switch this over to a HSV, switch this to far, and then this color just make it to far, and then this color just make it to far, and then this color just make it red. It's going to create this big kind red. It's going to create this big kind red. It's going to create this big kind of rainbow situation. And then once you of rainbow situation. And then once you of rainbow situation. And then once you have that established, you can go get a have that established, you can go get a have that established, you can go get a hue, saturation, value node and play hue, saturation, value node and play hue, saturation, value node and play around with values until you start to around with values until you start to around with values until you start to like the situation that you're in. This like the situation that you're in. This like the situation that you're in. This is cool. I think we can run with this is cool. I think we can run with this is cool. I think we can run with this one um for this tutorial. This looks one um for this tutorial. This looks one um for this tutorial. This looks awesome. And then now we can just go awesome. And then now we can just go awesome. And then now we can just go ahead back to the geometry nodes editor ahead back to the geometry nodes editor ahead back to the geometry nodes editor and just see how it would look as final and just see how it would look as final and just see how it would look as final density. So, what? 1,000. No, 600. density. So, what? 1,000. No, 600. density. So, what? 1,000. No, 600. 600 on the density. There we go. This is 600 on the density. There we go. This is 600 on the density. There we go. This is how it would look as a final. Now, we're how it would look as a final. Now, we're how it would look as a final. Now, we're not quite done yet. This bottom color, I not quite done yet. This bottom color, I not quite done yet. This bottom color, I do want to go ahead and select that. So, do want to go ahead and select that. So, do want to go ahead and select that. So, I'm just going to click on the bottom um I'm just going to click on the bottom um I'm just going to click on the bottom um t that's geometry notes. We'll just go t that's geometry notes. We'll just go t that's geometry notes. We'll just go over here and then say make it kind of over here and then say make it kind of over here and then say make it kind of like that yellow that we're getting like that yellow that we're getting like that yellow that we're getting beneath. That'll kind of keep everything beneath. That'll kind of keep everything beneath. That'll kind of keep everything cohesive. You can even make it, you cohesive. You can even make it, you cohesive. You can even make it, you know, like a light purple if you want. know, like a light purple if you want. know, like a light purple if you want. uh just kind of keeping it in the uh just kind of keeping it in the uh just kind of keeping it in the family. You can even make it emissive. family. You can even make it emissive. family. You can even make it emissive. Uh but in this case, we're just going to Uh but in this case, we're just going to Uh but in this case, we're just going to keep it uh like this so it's nice and keep it uh like this so it's nice and keep it uh like this so it's nice and readable. Now, for lighting, uh with readable. Now, for lighting, uh with readable. Now, for lighting, uh with shots like this, you can actually go shots like this, you can actually go shots like this, you can actually go simpler, and that's going to give you uh simpler, and that's going to give you uh simpler, and that's going to give you uh a more interesting looking animation. a more interesting looking animation. a more interesting looking animation. So, I'm going to hit the drop down, hits So, I'm going to hit the drop down, hits So, I'm going to hit the drop down, hits on, hit on scene, world, scene, lights, on, hit on scene, world, scene, lights, on, hit on scene, world, scene, lights, and we're going to go get a light area. and we're going to go get a light area. and we're going to go get a light area. Hit up. Let's see. We need to go see the Hit up. Let's see. We need to go see the Hit up. Let's see. We need to go see the gizmos. I'm going to go here to actually gizmos. I'm going to go here to actually gizmos. I'm going to go here to actually we'll just keep it flat. we'll just keep it flat. we'll just keep it flat. And then we'll bring it up. I always put my lights way too close. I always put my lights way too close. I always put my lights way too close. And I'm going hit R twice. And then And I'm going hit R twice. And then And I'm going hit R twice. And then scale the thing up pretty aggressively. scale the thing up pretty aggressively. scale the thing up pretty aggressively. And then give your power of like 3,000. And then give your power of like 3,000. And then give your power of like 3,000. So that's starting to look good. Um, So that's starting to look good. Um, So that's starting to look good. Um, let's bring that spread in a little bit. let's bring that spread in a little bit. let's bring that spread in a little bit. And then you can go maybe uh 10,000. And then you can go maybe uh 10,000. And then you can go maybe uh 10,000. All right, that looks that looks pretty All right, that looks that looks pretty All right, that looks that looks pretty good. And then you can also bring your good. And then you can also bring your good. And then you can also bring your world brightness up a little bit if you world brightness up a little bit if you world brightness up a little bit if you want to even out those shadows or make want to even out those shadows or make want to even out those shadows or make the shadows really aggressive and make the shadows really aggressive and make the shadows really aggressive and make them super dark. Whatever you want to them super dark. Whatever you want to them super dark. Whatever you want to do. And then here in the particle do. And then here in the particle do. And then here in the particle system, I'm going to go open up that system, I'm going to go open up that system, I'm going to go open up that window again that I sadly deleted. And window again that I sadly deleted. And window again that I sadly deleted. And I'm going to bring up my density again. I'm going to bring up my density again. I'm going to bring up my density again. So right now it's at 600. We're going to So right now it's at 600. We're going to So right now it's at 600. We're going to do 1200 do 1200 do 1200 to make it fully nice and dense. And to make it fully nice and dense. And to make it fully nice and dense. And then let's go ahead and render this out then let's go ahead and render this out then let's go ahead and render this out and see how this would look as a final and see how this would look as a final and see how this would look as a final image. All right. So, this is a final image. All right. So, this is a final image. All right. So, this is a final look at what it would look like look at what it would look like look at what it would look like rendered. One thing I think is the rendered. One thing I think is the rendered. One thing I think is the shadows are too long for what I want it shadows are too long for what I want it shadows are too long for what I want it to be. So, I'm going to just go ahead to be. So, I'm going to just go ahead to be. So, I'm going to just go ahead and that tells me I just want to bring and that tells me I just want to bring and that tells me I just want to bring up the height up the height up the height of my light. So, I'm just going to go of my light. So, I'm just going to go of my light. So, I'm just going to go ahead and say go up a little bit and ahead and say go up a little bit and ahead and say go up a little bit and then point down. I still want a little then point down. I still want a little then point down. I still want a little bit of that like what I'm getting. So, bit of that like what I'm getting. So, bit of that like what I'm getting. So, that looks super nice. Now, what we need that looks super nice. Now, what we need that looks super nice. Now, what we need to do is just animate our particles uh to do is just animate our particles uh to do is just animate our particles uh in a loop so that this looks really in a loop so that this looks really in a loop so that this looks really cool. So, that would be the W of this cool. So, that would be the W of this cool. So, that would be the W of this noise texture. Right now, it's way too noise texture. Right now, it's way too noise texture. Right now, it's way too dense to see that in real time. So, I'm dense to see that in real time. So, I'm dense to see that in real time. So, I'm going to do maybe a density of 50 for going to do maybe a density of 50 for going to do maybe a density of 50 for now so we can look at these particles now so we can look at these particles now so we can look at these particles move in real time. So, let's go ahead. move in real time. So, let's go ahead. move in real time. So, let's go ahead. I'm going to highlight this and hit G I'm going to highlight this and hit G I'm going to highlight this and hit G and move them down. And let's go ahead and move them down. And let's go ahead and move them down. And let's go ahead and get ourselves some space. So, and get ourselves some space. So, and get ourselves some space. So, I'm going to hit I'm going to hit shift I'm going to hit I'm going to hit shift I'm going to hit I'm going to hit shift and rightclick just to keep these two and rightclick just to keep these two and rightclick just to keep these two connections uh the same. I'm going to go connections uh the same. I'm going to go connections uh the same. I'm going to go ahead here on the W, make it zero. We're ahead here on the W, make it zero. We're ahead here on the W, make it zero. We're going to duplicate this noise texture. going to duplicate this noise texture. going to duplicate this noise texture. We're going to get a mix color node and We're going to get a mix color node and We're going to get a mix color node and plug these two here. So, now what we're plug these two here. So, now what we're plug these two here. So, now what we're going to do is loop the W. So, now the going to do is loop the W. So, now the going to do is loop the W. So, now the scale is really small. So, the W values scale is really small. So, the W values scale is really small. So, the W values are going to need to be pretty high for are going to need to be pretty high for are going to need to be pretty high for this to to move. I mean, relatively this to to move. I mean, relatively this to to move. I mean, relatively fast. So, what I'll do is we'll go make fast. So, what I'll do is we'll go make fast. So, what I'll do is we'll go make sure in your preferences in the sure in your preferences in the sure in your preferences in the animation tab, your default animation tab, your default animation tab, your default interpolation is linear. And then what interpolation is linear. And then what interpolation is linear. And then what I'll do is here in the W, I'm going to I'll do is here in the W, I'm going to I'll do is here in the W, I'm going to hit I. Here in the factor, bring it to hit I. Here in the factor, bring it to hit I. Here in the factor, bring it to the left, hit I. I'm going to go to the the left, hit I. I'm going to go to the the left, hit I. I'm going to go to the end, bring that factor over, hit I, and end, bring that factor over, hit I, and end, bring that factor over, hit I, and then we're going to do a uh a scale of then we're going to do a uh a scale of then we're going to do a uh a scale of four. And then right here, now that four. And then right here, now that four. And then right here, now that we're at the very end, hit I. Go to the we're at the very end, hit I. Go to the we're at the very end, hit I. Go to the end and type in -4 because we did end and type in -4 because we did end and type in -4 because we did positive four on the other one. And we positive four on the other one. And we positive four on the other one. And we should see, let's see, is this real should see, let's see, is this real should see, let's see, is this real time? That's 14 frames a second. So, we time? That's 14 frames a second. So, we time? That's 14 frames a second. So, we need to bring this density to like 10. need to bring this density to like 10. need to bring this density to like 10. There we go. So, this is real time. So, There we go. So, this is real time. So, There we go. So, this is real time. So, this is as fast as your particles are this is as fast as your particles are this is as fast as your particles are going to be moving um once you're done going to be moving um once you're done going to be moving um once you're done rendering it. I think this is a really rendering it. I think this is a really rendering it. I think this is a really nice speed. Now, for my final, I'm going nice speed. Now, for my final, I'm going nice speed. Now, for my final, I'm going to go ahead and save my file. And then to go ahead and save my file. And then to go ahead and save my file. And then for my final, I want my density to be for my final, I want my density to be for my final, I want my density to be 1,200. So, we have a lot of particles. 1,200. So, we have a lot of particles. 1,200. So, we have a lot of particles. The lighting will hit them. The thing The lighting will hit them. The thing The lighting will hit them. The thing about having lots of uh thing about about having lots of uh thing about about having lots of uh thing about particle systems is if you have small particle systems is if you have small particle systems is if you have small particles, you need a large volume of particles, you need a large volume of particles, you need a large volume of them in order for the lighting to them in order for the lighting to them in order for the lighting to actually uh hit it and look good and it actually uh hit it and look good and it actually uh hit it and look good and it feel nice. Uh much like making this feel nice. Uh much like making this feel nice. Uh much like making this whole particle system as a collective be whole particle system as a collective be whole particle system as a collective be one single solid object. So that is uh one single solid object. So that is uh one single solid object. So that is uh sometimes why maybe you feel like your sometimes why maybe you feel like your sometimes why maybe you feel like your particle systems don't look good. It's particle systems don't look good. It's particle systems don't look good. It's because you don't have enough particles. because you don't have enough particles. because you don't have enough particles. But now that we're finished, this is a But now that we're finished, this is a But now that we're finished, this is a final. I can actually say, okay, make it final. I can actually say, okay, make it final. I can actually say, okay, make it the full density. We can go ahead and the full density. We can go ahead and the full density. We can go ahead and render this out. So, as for your render render this out. So, as for your render render this out. So, as for your render settings, I'm going to go 1920 x 1080. settings, I'm going to go 1920 x 1080. settings, I'm going to go 1920 x 1080. I'm going to do a uh p I'm going to tell I'm going to do a uh p I'm going to tell I'm going to do a uh p I'm going to tell it to do a PNG sequence, and then I'll it to do a PNG sequence, and then I'll it to do a PNG sequence, and then I'll sequence that together. If you don't sequence that together. If you don't sequence that together. If you don't want to do a PNG sequence and you just want to do a PNG sequence and you just want to do a PNG sequence and you just want Blender to give you MP4 out the want Blender to give you MP4 out the want Blender to give you MP4 out the box, which I don't encourage, but you box, which I don't encourage, but you box, which I don't encourage, but you totally can. Um, we can go here to a totally can. Um, we can go here to a totally can. Um, we can go here to a FFmpeg video, pick your file, encoding FFmpeg video, pick your file, encoding FFmpeg video, pick your file, encoding to MP4 to MP4 to MP4 or QuickTime if you're on Mac, and then or QuickTime if you're on Mac, and then or QuickTime if you're on Mac, and then medium quality to perceptually lossless. medium quality to perceptually lossless. medium quality to perceptually lossless. render render animation and when you're render render animation and when you're render render animation and when you're done you'll have something really cool done you'll have something really cool done you'll have something really cool like mine. So there you go. Hope you like mine. So there you go. Hope you like mine. So there you go. Hope you guys enjoyed it. Again, if you want to guys enjoyed it. Again, if you want to guys enjoyed it. Again, if you want to learn tons of more really cool things learn tons of more really cool things learn tons of more really cool things about particle systems and geometry about particle systems and geometry about particle systems and geometry nodes, I have a whole series on my nodes, I have a whole series on my nodes, I have a whole series on my Patreon. You can check that out in the Patreon. You can check that out in the Patreon. You can check that out in the description. But with that, I hope you description. But with that, I hope you description. But with that, I hope you learned something cool. Hope you can learned something cool. Hope you can learned something cool. Hope you can apply this to other things. and I'll see apply this to other things. and I'll see apply this to other things. and I'll see you in the next one.
