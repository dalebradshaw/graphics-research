How's it going? In this tutorial, I'm How's it going? In this tutorial, I'm How's it going? In this tutorial, I'm going to show you how to create this going to show you how to create this going to show you how to create this animation right here. There's actually animation right here. There's actually animation right here. There's actually going to be two animations in this going to be two animations in this going to be two animations in this tutorial that you'll be able to pick tutorial that you'll be able to pick tutorial that you'll be able to pick from, or you can do both. Here's the from, or you can do both. Here's the from, or you can do both. Here's the steps that we're going to go through to steps that we're going to go through to steps that we're going to go through to create this animation. First, we need to create this animation. First, we need to create this animation. First, we need to simulate an array of curves. Then, we're simulate an array of curves. Then, we're simulate an array of curves. Then, we're going to go ahead and displace those going to go ahead and displace those going to go ahead and displace those curves. Each curve needs its own W value curves. Each curve needs its own W value curves. Each curve needs its own W value to give it a little bit more of a to give it a little bit more of a to give it a little bit more of a realistic stringy look. Then we can use realistic stringy look. Then we can use realistic stringy look. Then we can use a little bit of math to isolate the a little bit of math to isolate the a little bit of math to isolate the displacement to the center. Or we can displacement to the center. Or we can displacement to the center. Or we can use a different set of nodes to animate use a different set of nodes to animate use a different set of nodes to animate the string coming in and out. After the string coming in and out. After the string coming in and out. After that, we just need to add some color, that, we just need to add some color, that, we just need to add some color, add some lighting, and we'll be done. add some lighting, and we'll be done. add some lighting, and we'll be done. This is a geometry node tutorial. And if This is a geometry node tutorial. And if This is a geometry node tutorial. And if you are new to geometry nodes, don't you are new to geometry nodes, don't you are new to geometry nodes, don't worry. We're going to be going step by worry. We're going to be going step by worry. We're going to be going step by step, and I'll be explaining everything. step, and I'll be explaining everything. step, and I'll be explaining everything. This tutorial is actually a free lesson This tutorial is actually a free lesson This tutorial is actually a free lesson from a series of tutorials I just did on from a series of tutorials I just did on from a series of tutorials I just did on Patreon talking about using simulation Patreon talking about using simulation Patreon talking about using simulation zones as a way to create arrays which zones as a way to create arrays which zones as a way to create arrays which helped go around a few kind of stumbling helped go around a few kind of stumbling helped go around a few kind of stumbling blocks in geometry nodes to make some blocks in geometry nodes to make some blocks in geometry nodes to make some really really interesting animations. really really interesting animations. really really interesting animations. You can find the collection on my You can find the collection on my You can find the collection on my Patreon called the simulation arrays and Patreon called the simulation arrays and Patreon called the simulation arrays and it just dives into that idea. You can it just dives into that idea. You can it just dives into that idea. You can check out my Patreon linked in the check out my Patreon linked in the check out my Patreon linked in the description and let's dive into this description and let's dive into this description and let's dive into this tutorial. So, first we're going to go tutorial. So, first we're going to go tutorial. So, first we're going to go ahead and throw a piece of geometry into ahead and throw a piece of geometry into ahead and throw a piece of geometry into our scene. And I'm going to go and cut our scene. And I'm going to go and cut our scene. And I'm going to go and cut my window in half up here. We're going my window in half up here. We're going my window in half up here. We're going to switch it over to the geometry nodes to switch it over to the geometry nodes to switch it over to the geometry nodes editor. I'm going to hit N to move that. editor. I'm going to hit N to move that. editor. I'm going to hit N to move that. We're going to get a new window and We're going to get a new window and We're going to get a new window and we're going to go ahead and delete this we're going to go ahead and delete this we're going to go ahead and delete this input and we're going to go ahead and input and we're going to go ahead and input and we're going to go ahead and get a quadratic bezier. So, shift a get a quadratic bezier. So, shift a get a quadratic bezier. So, shift a search quadratic bezier. We're going to search quadratic bezier. We're going to search quadratic bezier. We're going to plug it right into here. First, what plug it right into here. First, what plug it right into here. First, what we're going to do is notice this we're going to do is notice this we're going to do is notice this quadratic bezier is just curved right quadratic bezier is just curved right quadratic bezier is just curved right now. I'm going to go ahead and click and now. I'm going to go ahead and click and now. I'm going to go ahead and click and drag. Bring it down to zero. And on the drag. Bring it down to zero. And on the drag. Bring it down to zero. And on the y-axis, we're going to give it a value y-axis, we're going to give it a value y-axis, we're going to give it a value of four. That's going to stretch that of four. That's going to stretch that of four. That's going to stretch that curve that direction. And we're going to curve that direction. And we're going to curve that direction. And we're going to give it a resolution of 400. Now, we're give it a resolution of 400. Now, we're give it a resolution of 400. Now, we're going to go ahead get a going to go ahead get a going to go ahead get a transform geometry node. And I just want transform geometry node. And I just want transform geometry node. And I just want to bring this curve here to the center to bring this curve here to the center to bring this curve here to the center of the scene. Not necessary, but it's of the scene. Not necessary, but it's of the scene. Not necessary, but it's just something that I like uh to have just something that I like uh to have just something that I like uh to have everything centered out. And then now everything centered out. And then now everything centered out. And then now we're going to go ahead and add the we're going to go ahead and add the we're going to go ahead and add the simulation zone. Now, if this is your simulation zone. Now, if this is your simulation zone. Now, if this is your first time using simulation zones, this first time using simulation zones, this first time using simulation zones, this is actually a perfect gateway into it. is actually a perfect gateway into it. is actually a perfect gateway into it. So just search simulation So just search simulation So just search simulation and we're going to go ahead and plug and we're going to go ahead and plug and we're going to go ahead and plug these here. So what we want to do these here. So what we want to do these here. So what we want to do is simulate a movement. And what I want is simulate a movement. And what I want is simulate a movement. And what I want to do is get a transform geometry. And I to do is get a transform geometry. And I to do is get a transform geometry. And I want to simulate it going this want to simulate it going this want to simulate it going this direction. And what a simulation is direction. And what a simulation is direction. And what a simulation is going to do is repeat an action every going to do is repeat an action every going to do is repeat an action every single frame. And so what I want to do single frame. And so what I want to do single frame. And so what I want to do is to go 01, duplicate another one at is to go 01, duplicate another one at is to go 01, duplicate another one at that distance every frame. And so what that distance every frame. And so what that distance every frame. And so what we need to do is get a join geometry we need to do is get a join geometry we need to do is get a join geometry node. And then we we're just going to go node. And then we we're just going to go node. And then we we're just going to go ahead from outside of the simulation ahead from outside of the simulation ahead from outside of the simulation zone do that. Now make sure you're not zone do that. Now make sure you're not zone do that. Now make sure you're not doing this. That's going to in be insane doing this. That's going to in be insane doing this. That's going to in be insane for your computer. We want to go outside for your computer. We want to go outside for your computer. We want to go outside of it. Otherwise, it's going to be of it. Otherwise, it's going to be of it. Otherwise, it's going to be duplicating geometry way too much. So, duplicating geometry way too much. So, duplicating geometry way too much. So, now that we have this, if I press play, now that we have this, if I press play, now that we have this, if I press play, we're now getting an array. Now, the way we're now getting an array. Now, the way we're now getting an array. Now, the way that I used to do this is to get a a that I used to do this is to get a a that I used to do this is to get a a line and then instance objects on the line and then instance objects on the line and then instance objects on the points of that line. The problem is when points of that line. The problem is when points of that line. The problem is when I want to go ahead and displace the I want to go ahead and displace the I want to go ahead and displace the curves that are instance on that line, curves that are instance on that line, curves that are instance on that line, it displaces the line, not the curves on it displaces the line, not the curves on it displaces the line, not the curves on the line. Hope that makes sense. This the line. Hope that makes sense. This the line. Hope that makes sense. This goes around it and offers some really, goes around it and offers some really, goes around it and offers some really, really cool things that I dived into on really cool things that I dived into on really cool things that I dived into on Patreon. So, a lot of really cool things Patreon. So, a lot of really cool things Patreon. So, a lot of really cool things to explore just with the simple idea to explore just with the simple idea to explore just with the simple idea with simulations. Now, with me, you can with simulations. Now, with me, you can with simulations. Now, with me, you can see I have 46 frames. That means I have see I have 46 frames. That means I have see I have 46 frames. That means I have 46 objects. I want to get about 38. 46 objects. I want to get about 38. 46 objects. I want to get about 38. And then we can And then we can And then we can we can bake this in just like that. And we can bake this in just like that. And we can bake this in just like that. And it's going to tell you we have baked it's going to tell you we have baked it's going to tell you we have baked frame 38. In this case, that means we frame 38. In this case, that means we frame 38. In this case, that means we have 38 instances. Now, what I want to have 38 instances. Now, what I want to have 38 instances. Now, what I want to do is get another transform geometry and do is get another transform geometry and do is get another transform geometry and just bring this guy to the center as just bring this guy to the center as just bring this guy to the center as well. Again, not necessary. It's really well. Again, not necessary. It's really well. Again, not necessary. It's really just for me. Um, now let's go ahead and just for me. Um, now let's go ahead and just for me. Um, now let's go ahead and displace this. So, we're going to get a displace this. So, we're going to get a displace this. So, we're going to get a set position node and we're going to get set position node and we're going to get set position node and we're going to get a noise texture. So, what I want is to a noise texture. So, what I want is to a noise texture. So, what I want is to displace it only on the X. So, we need displace it only on the X. So, we need displace it only on the X. So, we need to get a combine to get a combine to get a combine XYZ node which will allow us to now have XYZ node which will allow us to now have XYZ node which will allow us to now have access to one single axis. Plug factor access to one single axis. Plug factor access to one single axis. Plug factor into Z. And then I'm going to use the into Z. And then I'm going to use the into Z. And then I'm going to use the normalize. Notice how it kind of went normalize. Notice how it kind of went normalize. Notice how it kind of went above. Normalize will keep it centered. above. Normalize will keep it centered. above. Normalize will keep it centered. But now this is far far too strong. So But now this is far far too strong. So But now this is far far too strong. So we can use a math node to edit the we can use a math node to edit the we can use a math node to edit the strength of this effect with the strength of this effect with the strength of this effect with the multiply function. Multiply is going to multiply function. Multiply is going to multiply function. Multiply is going to play with the strength of a particular play with the strength of a particular play with the strength of a particular action. So now we can bring the detail action. So now we can bring the detail action. So now we can bring the detail down to zero. We can bring that scale down to zero. We can bring that scale down to zero. We can bring that scale up. Actually, maybe bring the detail a up. Actually, maybe bring the detail a up. Actually, maybe bring the detail a little bit up. And then switch this over little bit up. And then switch this over little bit up. And then switch this over to 4D. And we can look at that movement. to 4D. And we can look at that movement. to 4D. And we can look at that movement. There is one thing that I don't There is one thing that I don't There is one thing that I don't particularly like with this idea. Notice particularly like with this idea. Notice particularly like with this idea. Notice how all of the strings are kind of all how all of the strings are kind of all how all of the strings are kind of all the strings are being affected by the the strings are being affected by the the strings are being affected by the same exact noise texture, specifically same exact noise texture, specifically same exact noise texture, specifically the same value of the W. All these the same value of the W. All these the same value of the W. All these things are the same, right? And so the things are the same, right? And so the things are the same, right? And so the value of the W is like a seed value, but value of the W is like a seed value, but value of the W is like a seed value, but all of them are being animated. So they all of them are being animated. So they all of them are being animated. So they kind of look connected like a like this kind of look connected like a like this kind of look connected like a like this wave. All of them have this wave this wave. All of them have this wave this wave. All of them have this wave this way and this way and it's all you know way and this way and it's all you know way and this way and it's all you know they all look in relation to each other they all look in relation to each other they all look in relation to each other way in in this wave together that way in in this wave together that way in in this wave together that doesn't give this really stringy organic doesn't give this really stringy organic doesn't give this really stringy organic look that I personally want for this look that I personally want for this look that I personally want for this which means I want each one of these which means I want each one of these which means I want each one of these strings to have its own value of the W. strings to have its own value of the W. strings to have its own value of the W. So say like this string is on this value So say like this string is on this value So say like this string is on this value 2.48 48 and another string is going to 2.48 48 and another string is going to 2.48 48 and another string is going to have this value which will put them at have this value which will put them at have this value which will put them at random points which is what I want. Now random points which is what I want. Now random points which is what I want. Now how do you do that? I'm going to go how do you do that? I'm going to go how do you do that? I'm going to go ahead and give myself a little bit more ahead and give myself a little bit more ahead and give myself a little bit more space here and we're going to get an space here and we're going to get an space here and we're going to get an attribute. So we're going to get a store attribute. So we're going to get a store attribute. So we're going to get a store named attribute node. We're going to get named attribute node. We're going to get named attribute node. We're going to get a random value and we want to use a a random value and we want to use a a random value and we want to use a random value for the W giving each one random value for the W giving each one random value for the W giving each one of these strings its own random W value. of these strings its own random W value. of these strings its own random W value. How do you do that? So here in the store How do you do that? So here in the store How do you do that? So here in the store named attribute, I want it to recognize named attribute, I want it to recognize named attribute, I want it to recognize the splines. We're just going to give it the splines. We're just going to give it the splines. We're just going to give it a name of R just for random. And you can a name of R just for random. And you can a name of R just for random. And you can plug this right here. So now that we plug this right here. So now that we plug this right here. So now that we have an attribute that is assigning a a have an attribute that is assigning a a have an attribute that is assigning a a unique value to each one of these unique value to each one of these unique value to each one of these strings cuz it recognizes each one of strings cuz it recognizes each one of strings cuz it recognizes each one of those curves through telling it to those curves through telling it to those curves through telling it to recognize curves and assign a random recognize curves and assign a random recognize curves and assign a random value to each one of those curves. value to each one of those curves. value to each one of those curves. That's what this does. So now we can get That's what this does. So now we can get That's what this does. So now we can get a attribute node, a named attribute a attribute node, a named attribute a attribute node, a named attribute call. Looks like it's a capital R. I call. Looks like it's a capital R. I call. Looks like it's a capital R. I don't know why I did a capital. And then don't know why I did a capital. And then don't know why I did a capital. And then watch what happens if I go ahead and watch what happens if I go ahead and watch what happens if I go ahead and plug this attribute into the W. Instead plug this attribute into the W. Instead plug this attribute into the W. Instead of now just one value, we're getting of now just one value, we're getting of now just one value, we're getting multiple values in the W. And this is multiple values in the W. And this is multiple values in the W. And this is awesome. Two things. We can't adjust the awesome. Two things. We can't adjust the awesome. Two things. We can't adjust the strength of this effect. And we also no strength of this effect. And we also no strength of this effect. And we also no longer have an ability to animate the W. longer have an ability to animate the W. longer have an ability to animate the W. But we could fix that with a math node But we could fix that with a math node But we could fix that with a math node right here. So if you play with add, if right here. So if you play with add, if right here. So if you play with add, if you just want to animate, the add you just want to animate, the add you just want to animate, the add function right here is exactly function right here is exactly function right here is exactly the W slider. See that? It does the same the W slider. See that? It does the same the W slider. See that? It does the same exact thing, but in case we now have exact thing, but in case we now have exact thing, but in case we now have access to it. So now it's randomly uh access to it. So now it's randomly uh access to it. So now it's randomly uh animating the W of all these random animating the W of all these random animating the W of all these random values. But what we can do is actually values. But what we can do is actually values. But what we can do is actually get a multiply add node. And if you get a multiply add node. And if you get a multiply add node. And if you bring the multiply to zero, it's like, bring the multiply to zero, it's like, bring the multiply to zero, it's like, okay, we're no longer random randomizing okay, we're no longer random randomizing okay, we're no longer random randomizing it. And so you can just kind of bring in it. And so you can just kind of bring in it. And so you can just kind of bring in a little bit of randomization. So it a little bit of randomization. So it a little bit of randomization. So it still looks like they're all kind of a still looks like they're all kind of a still looks like they're all kind of a part of this big wave, but they still part of this big wave, but they still part of this big wave, but they still have a little bit of individuality to have a little bit of individuality to have a little bit of individuality to them. Or you can kind of go crazy with them. Or you can kind of go crazy with them. Or you can kind of go crazy with it and have them all just look like it and have them all just look like it and have them all just look like they're doing their own thing. I do kind they're doing their own thing. I do kind they're doing their own thing. I do kind of like a mix of this and that, giving of like a mix of this and that, giving of like a mix of this and that, giving it just a little bit of this organic it just a little bit of this organic it just a little bit of this organic stringy motion, but they're all kind of stringy motion, but they're all kind of stringy motion, but they're all kind of wave and a wave together in this kind of wave and a wave together in this kind of wave and a wave together in this kind of interesting way. We're going to go ahead interesting way. We're going to go ahead interesting way. We're going to go ahead and isolate this uh displacement. But and isolate this uh displacement. But and isolate this uh displacement. But first, I kind of want to look at some first, I kind of want to look at some first, I kind of want to look at some geometry to make it look better. So, geometry to make it look better. So, geometry to make it look better. So, we're going to go ahead and get a curve we're going to go ahead and get a curve we're going to go ahead and get a curve to mesh and we're going to get a curve circle and we're going to get a curve circle and we're going to get a curve circle for the geometry. So, I'm going to give for the geometry. So, I'm going to give for the geometry. So, I'm going to give it a radius of 0.4 and plug curve into it a radius of 0.4 and plug curve into it a radius of 0.4 and plug curve into profile. Now, we have our strings and we profile. Now, we have our strings and we profile. Now, we have our strings and we can go back and kind of look at how that can go back and kind of look at how that can go back and kind of look at how that looks. It looks really cool and I love looks. It looks really cool and I love looks. It looks really cool and I love it. So, what I want to do is just have it. So, what I want to do is just have it. So, what I want to do is just have the displacement centered right here to the displacement centered right here to the displacement centered right here to the middle. So, we're going to go ahead the middle. So, we're going to go ahead the middle. So, we're going to go ahead and mix two things. We're going to mix a and mix two things. We're going to mix a and mix two things. We're going to mix a flat flat flat value and this whole situation here. So, value and this whole situation here. So, value and this whole situation here. So, what I'm going to do is going to mix what I'm going to do is going to mix what I'm going to do is going to mix vector. Now, we could use vector if we vector. Now, we could use vector if we vector. Now, we could use vector if we want. Uh, these are floats, so we're want. Uh, these are floats, so we're want. Uh, these are floats, so we're just going to use mix float just to keep just going to use mix float just to keep just going to use mix float just to keep it all uh technically correct, but the it all uh technically correct, but the it all uh technically correct, but the the vector would work, too. the vector would work, too. the vector would work, too. Now, we're going to mix this state with Now, we're going to mix this state with Now, we're going to mix this state with this state, and we're going to do that this state, and we're going to do that this state, and we're going to do that with the factor. So, what we can do, I'm with the factor. So, what we can do, I'm with the factor. So, what we can do, I'm just bring this down here. just bring this down here. just bring this down here. We're going to get a position node, and We're going to get a position node, and We're going to get a position node, and we're going to get a math node. I'm we're going to get a math node. I'm we're going to get a math node. I'm going to plug position into value and going to plug position into value and going to plug position into value and value into factor. And it's going to do value into factor. And it's going to do value into factor. And it's going to do this. If I play with the value, this. If I play with the value, this. If I play with the value, you can notice you can notice you can notice it's animating in. It's animating this it's animating in. It's animating this it's animating in. It's animating this dis this displacement in. Now, one thing dis this displacement in. Now, one thing dis this displacement in. Now, one thing I want to do is make sure any effect I I want to do is make sure any effect I I want to do is make sure any effect I do is actually moving this direction. do is actually moving this direction. do is actually moving this direction. So, what we're going to do is get a So, what we're going to do is get a So, what we're going to do is get a separate XYZ separate XYZ separate XYZ and and and confine it to the Y. Because if I play confine it to the Y. Because if I play confine it to the Y. Because if I play with the value now, you can see it's with the value now, you can see it's with the value now, you can see it's going the other direction from left to going the other direction from left to going the other direction from left to right. So, I wanted to make sure because right. So, I wanted to make sure because right. So, I wanted to make sure because once we add our pingpong function, it is once we add our pingpong function, it is once we add our pingpong function, it is going to going to going to need to be told which way to go. So, now need to be told which way to go. So, now need to be told which way to go. So, now we have this really cool function which we have this really cool function which we have this really cool function which you can also animate automatically. This you can also animate automatically. This you can also animate automatically. This is really cool and fun. So, we have this is really cool and fun. So, we have this is really cool and fun. So, we have this and now we're going to go ahead and add and now we're going to go ahead and add and now we're going to go ahead and add in a pingpong function to make sure that in a pingpong function to make sure that in a pingpong function to make sure that we can go from displacement flat we can go from displacement flat we can go from displacement flat essentially go flat displacement flat. essentially go flat displacement flat. essentially go flat displacement flat. And that is a ping-pong function if And that is a ping-pong function if And that is a ping-pong function if you're going one back to another. And so you're going one back to another. And so you're going one back to another. And so we're going to go ahead and get another we're going to go ahead and get another we're going to go ahead and get another math node and we're going to get D, if math node and we're going to get D, if math node and we're going to get D, if we can find it, ping pong. So if I bring we can find it, ping pong. So if I bring we can find it, ping pong. So if I bring that value up, you'll notice, that value up, you'll notice, that value up, you'll notice, bring that value into the negative, it's bring that value into the negative, it's bring that value into the negative, it's going to kind of isolate this. And so we going to kind of isolate this. And so we going to kind of isolate this. And so we can just bring this guy to the center can just bring this guy to the center can just bring this guy to the center with our value. But notice what this with our value. But notice what this with our value. But notice what this ping pong is doing. So it is doing a lot ping pong is doing. So it is doing a lot ping pong is doing. So it is doing a lot of like multiple ping pongs, which just of like multiple ping pongs, which just of like multiple ping pongs, which just makes it look regular. um bring that to makes it look regular. um bring that to makes it look regular. um bring that to a larger negative value. And now what a larger negative value. And now what a larger negative value. And now what it's taking is flat going to it's taking is flat going to it's taking is flat going to displacement and then going back to displacement and then going back to displacement and then going back to flat. That's what this function is doing flat. That's what this function is doing flat. That's what this function is doing in a really sort of layman's turn term in a really sort of layman's turn term in a really sort of layman's turn term way. So what we can do now is we can get way. So what we can do now is we can get way. So what we can do now is we can get another math node another math node another math node to edit the size to edit the size to edit the size of this ping pong function. So this add of this ping pong function. So this add of this ping pong function. So this add function plays with the position of function plays with the position of function plays with the position of where it's happening and this plays with where it's happening and this plays with where it's happening and this plays with the size which opens up an ability to the size which opens up an ability to the size which opens up an ability to actually animate it coming in. So I want actually animate it coming in. So I want actually animate it coming in. So I want to isolate it to somewhere around there. to isolate it to somewhere around there. to isolate it to somewhere around there. And then you can play with your multiply And then you can play with your multiply And then you can play with your multiply down here to say how strong you want down here to say how strong you want down here to say how strong you want that effect. And then you can animate it that effect. And then you can animate it that effect. And then you can animate it right here. And it's really really right here. And it's really really right here. And it's really really controllable and fun. So that's the controllable and fun. So that's the controllable and fun. So that's the first animation. You can just go ahead first animation. You can just go ahead first animation. You can just go ahead do that if you want. Now, I'm going to do that if you want. Now, I'm going to do that if you want. Now, I'm going to bring this all the way to the to the I'm bring this all the way to the to the I'm bring this all the way to the to the I'm going to bring this one all the way out going to bring this one all the way out going to bring this one all the way out so we can see all the displacement. What so we can see all the displacement. What so we can see all the displacement. What we can also do is trim it. So, what I we can also do is trim it. So, what I we can also do is trim it. So, what I can do is I'm going to just bring these can do is I'm going to just bring these can do is I'm going to just bring these guys over here and get a trim curves node. And if you play with the end, node. And if you play with the end, node. And if you play with the end, notice notice notice you can animate these guys actually you can animate these guys actually you can animate these guys actually coming in. Now, notice these are hollow. coming in. Now, notice these are hollow. coming in. Now, notice these are hollow. If you go here to the uh curve to mesh, If you go here to the uh curve to mesh, If you go here to the uh curve to mesh, it'll fill that up. But it's pretty it'll fill that up. But it's pretty it'll fill that up. But it's pretty cool. We can now animate this in. But cool. We can now animate this in. But cool. We can now animate this in. But what's not cool, at least with the style what's not cool, at least with the style what's not cool, at least with the style that I want, is that just it's just like that I want, is that just it's just like that I want, is that just it's just like you took scissors and cut it. I want to you took scissors and cut it. I want to you took scissors and cut it. I want to randomize randomize randomize um where they're at. And you could do um where they're at. And you could do um where they're at. And you could do that with a that with a that with a random value. Just plug a random value random value. Just plug a random value random value. Just plug a random value into the end function. And let's just into the end function. And let's just into the end function. And let's just give them both a value of zero and give them both a value of zero and give them both a value of zero and animate it in. So, see that? You just animate it in. So, see that? You just animate it in. So, see that? You just click and drag if you want them both to click and drag if you want them both to click and drag if you want them both to go together. And then I'll just pull one go together. And then I'll just pull one go together. And then I'll just pull one back. back. back. And now you have a little bit more of a And now you have a little bit more of a And now you have a little bit more of a natural look. And then if you click and natural look. And then if you click and natural look. And then if you click and drag them both, they'll just travel drag them both, they'll just travel drag them both, they'll just travel together. And now we have a really, together. And now we have a really, together. And now we have a really, really cool thing. So there you have really cool thing. So there you have really cool thing. So there you have that. I'm going to give them a value of that. I'm going to give them a value of that. I'm going to give them a value of one. And I'm going to go back to uh this one. And I'm going to go back to uh this one. And I'm going to go back to uh this effect. I'm going to go ahead and add effect. I'm going to go ahead and add effect. I'm going to go ahead and add our lighting. and all that stuff uh with our lighting. and all that stuff uh with our lighting. and all that stuff uh with this this look. This is my favorite look this this look. This is my favorite look this this look. This is my favorite look of the two, but both animations I can of the two, but both animations I can of the two, but both animations I can see, you know, people wanting and I see, you know, people wanting and I see, you know, people wanting and I wanted to show you guys you could do uh wanted to show you guys you could do uh wanted to show you guys you could do uh multiple things here. So, now we have multiple things here. So, now we have multiple things here. So, now we have this really cool effect. So, I think I'm this really cool effect. So, I think I'm this really cool effect. So, I think I'm ready to go ahead and add a camera, add ready to go ahead and add a camera, add ready to go ahead and add a camera, add some lighting, have a little bit of of some lighting, have a little bit of of some lighting, have a little bit of of fun with it. fun with it. fun with it. Just making some adjustments personally. Just making some adjustments personally. Just making some adjustments personally. Okay, let's go ahead and add a material Okay, let's go ahead and add a material Okay, let's go ahead and add a material to this. So, I'm going to go here to the to this. So, I'm going to go here to the to this. So, I'm going to go here to the end, get a end, get a end, get a set material node. And before we switch set material node. And before we switch set material node. And before we switch over to the shading, I do Let's go ahead over to the shading, I do Let's go ahead over to the shading, I do Let's go ahead and create a material. Before we switch and create a material. Before we switch and create a material. Before we switch over to the shading, I want to remind over to the shading, I want to remind over to the shading, I want to remind you we have an attribute over here that you we have an attribute over here that you we have an attribute over here that creates a random value. So, just creates a random value. So, just creates a random value. So, just remember that because we are going to remember that because we are going to remember that because we are going to use that in just a second um in the use that in just a second um in the use that in just a second um in the shading. So, there's nothing I want to shading. So, there's nothing I want to shading. So, there's nothing I want to do in this window right now. So, I'm do in this window right now. So, I'm do in this window right now. So, I'm just going to go ahead and switch it just going to go ahead and switch it just going to go ahead and switch it over to the shader editor. And now we over to the shader editor. And now we over to the shader editor. And now we have that material material 001. You can have that material material 001. You can have that material material 001. You can see we're using it by seeing that up see we're using it by seeing that up see we're using it by seeing that up there. So first let's get that attribute there. So first let's get that attribute there. So first let's get that attribute node and I'm going to switch this over node and I'm going to switch this over node and I'm going to switch this over to the material preview. to the material preview. to the material preview. If I plug So if I type in the letter R, If I plug So if I type in the letter R, If I plug So if I type in the letter R, which is going to call that attribute which is going to call that attribute which is going to call that attribute that we called to create the randomness, that we called to create the randomness, that we called to create the randomness, and we plug factor right into base and we plug factor right into base and we plug factor right into base color, we can see it's actually creating color, we can see it's actually creating color, we can see it's actually creating a little bit of randomness, random a little bit of randomness, random a little bit of randomness, random color, which is great. That's what I color, which is great. That's what I color, which is great. That's what I want. Um, in this particular style, want. Um, in this particular style, want. Um, in this particular style, we're just making it look cool with some we're just making it look cool with some we're just making it look cool with some random color. random color. random color. So, I'm going to go ahead and get my So, I'm going to go ahead and get my So, I'm going to go ahead and get my color ramp. We're going to get two color ramp. We're going to get two color ramp. We're going to get two colors. We're going to get kind of a a colors. We're going to get kind of a a colors. We're going to get kind of a a lightish gray. And then we're also going lightish gray. And then we're also going lightish gray. And then we're also going to go ahead and get something like that. And then we're just something like that. And then we're just something like that. And then we're just going to bring these two in. going to bring these two in. going to bring these two in. So, now we have pretty cool style. What So, now we have pretty cool style. What So, now we have pretty cool style. What I want to do is I'm going to go here to I want to do is I'm going to go here to I want to do is I'm going to go here to cycles. Give myself some lights for now. cycles. Give myself some lights for now. cycles. Give myself some lights for now. And here in the subsurface, I'm going to And here in the subsurface, I'm going to And here in the subsurface, I'm going to bring that weight up. Now, you can bring that weight up. Now, you can bring that weight up. Now, you can notice it kind of looks like skin, notice it kind of looks like skin, notice it kind of looks like skin, especially in the parts where there's especially in the parts where there's especially in the parts where there's shadow. That's just cuz these auto these shadow. That's just cuz these auto these shadow. That's just cuz these auto these default settings are uh set up for skin. default settings are uh set up for skin. default settings are uh set up for skin. If you just give them all a value of If you just give them all a value of If you just give them all a value of one, it'll just make them look normal one, it'll just make them look normal one, it'll just make them look normal quote unquote normal. It just doesn't quote unquote normal. It just doesn't quote unquote normal. It just doesn't add that skin kind of look. And then if add that skin kind of look. And then if add that skin kind of look. And then if you bring that scale up, you bring that scale up, you bring that scale up, it this scale is what says how much it this scale is what says how much it this scale is what says how much light we're letting into this. So this light we're letting into this. So this light we're letting into this. So this looks really nice. I'm going to go ahead looks really nice. I'm going to go ahead looks really nice. I'm going to go ahead and park with this and bring this window and park with this and bring this window and park with this and bring this window over. We're now going to deal with over. We're now going to deal with over. We're now going to deal with lighting. So I'm going to go and select lighting. So I'm going to go and select lighting. So I'm going to go and select my camera angle. my camera angle. my camera angle. Probably something like this. I'm going Probably something like this. I'm going Probably something like this. I'm going hit control alt0. Snap it to view. And hit control alt0. Snap it to view. And hit control alt0. Snap it to view. And I'm going to give myself a focal length I'm going to give myself a focal length I'm going to give myself a focal length focal length of like 120. I want this to focal length of like 120. I want this to focal length of like 120. I want this to look really flat look really flat look really flat in terms of the the the lens in terms of the the the lens in terms of the the the lens essentially. And so maybe something like that. Cool. Okay. So, we're going to go ahead Cool. Okay. So, we're going to go ahead Cool. Okay. So, we're going to go ahead and add some lighting. So, I'm going to and add some lighting. So, I'm going to and add some lighting. So, I'm going to bring this down and go just the scene bring this down and go just the scene bring this down and go just the scene world scene lights. So, we're going to world scene lights. So, we're going to world scene lights. So, we're going to get a light hitting it directly that get a light hitting it directly that get a light hitting it directly that way. So, let's go ahead and get an area way. So, let's go ahead and get an area way. So, let's go ahead and get an area light. I'm going to switch it over to a light. I'm going to switch it over to a light. I'm going to switch it over to a disc. disc. disc. Bring it over. I'm going hit R twice and then bring that give it a power of and then bring that give it a power of and then bring that give it a power of like I don't know 80. And then we can like I don't know 80. And then we can like I don't know 80. And then we can bring that spread down bring that spread down bring that spread down to something around to something around to something around these lines. And then maybe bring that these lines. And then maybe bring that these lines. And then maybe bring that power back down a little bit. And then power back down a little bit. And then power back down a little bit. And then bring that scale up some, too. Okay. So, bring that scale up some, too. Okay. So, bring that scale up some, too. Okay. So, we kind of have some soft lighting. we kind of have some soft lighting. we kind of have some soft lighting. Maybe bring that power up. What I want Maybe bring that power up. What I want Maybe bring that power up. What I want to do, I'm going just turn on my to do, I'm going just turn on my to do, I'm going just turn on my denoising. And I want to get a denoising. And I want to get a denoising. And I want to get a background, a nice soft background. And background, a nice soft background. And background, a nice soft background. And so, we're going to kind of do it maybe so, we're going to kind of do it maybe so, we're going to kind of do it maybe not in a totally traditional way. So, not in a totally traditional way. So, not in a totally traditional way. So, I'm going to take this. I'm going to do I'm going to take this. I'm going to do I'm going to take this. I'm going to do RX. RX. RX. I'm going hit R Y90. I'm going hit R Y90. I'm going hit R Y90. And then I want to bring this back far And then I want to bring this back far And then I want to bring this back far enough to where it can't it can't be enough to where it can't it can't be enough to where it can't it can't be affected by this light anymore. I want affected by this light anymore. I want affected by this light anymore. I want to be able to control it uh independent. to be able to control it uh independent. to be able to control it uh independent. And then I'm going to bring it down to a And then I'm going to bring it down to a And then I'm going to bring it down to a point where we can see it in the camera. point where we can see it in the camera. point where we can see it in the camera. And then we're going to get a point And then we're going to get a point And then we're going to get a point light. light. light. I hit G I hit G I hit G and just get this point light to be and just get this point light to be and just get this point light to be affecting affecting affecting our background. So, I'm gonna get a our background. So, I'm gonna get a our background. So, I'm gonna get a render region. And so, now we can play with this point And so, now we can play with this point And so, now we can play with this point light light light to be a nice highlight in the to be a nice highlight in the to be a nice highlight in the background. And if you want, which I'm background. And if you want, which I'm background. And if you want, which I'm going to do, I'm going to go over here. going to do, I'm going to go over here. going to do, I'm going to go over here. I'm going to go back to the shading and I'm going to go back to the shading and I'm going to go back to the shading and I'm going to hover over here and copy I'm going to hover over here and copy I'm going to hover over here and copy that color. And then in the point light, that color. And then in the point light, that color. And then in the point light, I'm going to go ahead and paste that I'm going to go ahead and paste that I'm going to go ahead and paste that color. And then just bring the color. And then just bring the color. And then just bring the saturation down. saturation down. saturation down. That's just a good look. That's just a good look. That's just a good look. And there we have it. If you want to And there we have it. If you want to And there we have it. If you want to bring that world brightness down to bring that world brightness down to bring that world brightness down to black, you can. That's going to give it black, you can. That's going to give it black, you can. That's going to give it more of a dramatic look, which again more of a dramatic look, which again more of a dramatic look, which again could be something you want. Then of could be something you want. Then of could be something you want. Then of course, if you don't like the sort of course, if you don't like the sort of course, if you don't like the sort of how dramatic these dark shadows are how dramatic these dark shadows are how dramatic these dark shadows are here, you can add another light, another here, you can add another light, another here, you can add another light, another area light area light area light down here. just to point at the bottom. And then you can control that. And then you can control that. And then you can control that. So something like this. There we go. Now So something like this. There we go. Now So something like this. There we go. Now you have a lot of control. So I'm going you have a lot of control. So I'm going you have a lot of control. So I'm going to go ahead and render this frame just to go ahead and render this frame just to go ahead and render this frame just to see how it looks as a final. So this to see how it looks as a final. So this to see how it looks as a final. So this is our final look. You can play with the is our final look. You can play with the is our final look. You can play with the lighting. I mean everything. You can lighting. I mean everything. You can lighting. I mean everything. You can play with everything to get it to be play with everything to get it to be play with everything to get it to be exactly how you want it to be. So, I exactly how you want it to be. So, I exactly how you want it to be. So, I want to go back to geometry nodes just want to go back to geometry nodes just want to go back to geometry nodes just to show you where you can animate it and to show you where you can animate it and to show you where you can animate it and just allow you to kind of make that just allow you to kind of make that just allow you to kind of make that decision for yourself. So, we can go decision for yourself. So, we can go decision for yourself. So, we can go back to the geometry nodes editor and back to the geometry nodes editor and back to the geometry nodes editor and look at all of our animation look at all of our animation look at all of our animation possibilities. possibilities. possibilities. If we go here to this big mix of math, If we go here to this big mix of math, If we go here to this big mix of math, we have this string of guys up here. You we have this string of guys up here. You we have this string of guys up here. You can play with this first value node to can play with this first value node to can play with this first value node to kind of bring this effect in like that. kind of bring this effect in like that. kind of bring this effect in like that. Now, if you do that, if you animate from Now, if you do that, if you animate from Now, if you do that, if you animate from here to here, I would recommend do it here to here, I would recommend do it here to here, I would recommend do it while simultaneously while simultaneously while simultaneously animating this W value on the ad end. animating this W value on the ad end. animating this W value on the ad end. So, it gives it way more life. So, you So, it gives it way more life. So, you So, it gives it way more life. So, you can do that. You also have this add node can do that. You also have this add node can do that. You also have this add node animating this growth animating this growth animating this growth just like that. And again, if you're just like that. And again, if you're just like that. And again, if you're going to do that, I would say have this going to do that, I would say have this going to do that, I would say have this W value moving while this guy comes in W value moving while this guy comes in W value moving while this guy comes in and out. And then of course and out. And then of course and out. And then of course you have this trim curve node. you have this trim curve node. you have this trim curve node. You can go ahead and give it a little You can go ahead and give it a little You can go ahead and give it a little bit of randomness. bit of randomness. bit of randomness. And then I would say bring the strength And then I would say bring the strength And then I would say bring the strength down a little bit for this effect. And down a little bit for this effect. And down a little bit for this effect. And then you can play with that trim curves then you can play with that trim curves then you can play with that trim curves to animate in just like that. And this to animate in just like that. And this to animate in just like that. And this is the one that I would say maybe don't is the one that I would say maybe don't is the one that I would say maybe don't animate the W value. I do like this, animate the W value. I do like this, animate the W value. I do like this, you know, I like how that looks. But you know, I like how that looks. But you know, I like how that looks. But again, it is all completely up to what again, it is all completely up to what again, it is all completely up to what you want to do, how you want to animate you want to do, how you want to animate you want to do, how you want to animate it, and I'll leave that completely up to it, and I'll leave that completely up to it, and I'll leave that completely up to you. So, that is how you create this you. So, that is how you create this you. So, that is how you create this string effect. It's really, really string effect. It's really, really string effect. It's really, really powerful. Tons of different ways you can powerful. Tons of different ways you can powerful. Tons of different ways you can do this, controlling the curves, adding do this, controlling the curves, adding do this, controlling the curves, adding textures, adding materials, different textures, adding materials, different textures, adding materials, different context to make this really, really context to make this really, really context to make this really, really useful in your own animations. But with useful in your own animations. But with useful in your own animations.
