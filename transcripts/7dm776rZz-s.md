How's it going, guys? So, in this How's it going, guys? So, in this How's it going, guys? So, in this tutorial, we are going to be creating tutorial, we are going to be creating tutorial, we are going to be creating this animation right here. It's going to this animation right here. It's going to this animation right here. It's going to be super fun and pretty easy. First be super fun and pretty easy. First be super fun and pretty easy. First thing we're going to do is hop into thing we're going to do is hop into thing we're going to do is hop into geometry nodes and create some geometry nodes and create some geometry nodes and create some displacement and shape it to look more displacement and shape it to look more displacement and shape it to look more like hills. After that, I'll show you like hills. After that, I'll show you like hills. After that, I'll show you how to mirror displacement in geometry how to mirror displacement in geometry how to mirror displacement in geometry nodes. And that's going to allow us to nodes. And that's going to allow us to nodes. And that's going to allow us to create our camera and make a looping create our camera and make a looping create our camera and make a looping animation with the displacement. Then, animation with the displacement. Then, animation with the displacement. Then, we're going to hop into the shading, and we're going to hop into the shading, and we're going to hop into the shading, and I'm going to show you a simple way to I'm going to show you a simple way to I'm going to show you a simple way to make a really nice stepped gradient make a really nice stepped gradient make a really nice stepped gradient effect. Then we're going to combine two effect. Then we're going to combine two effect. Then we're going to combine two different wave textures to create a different wave textures to create a different wave textures to create a really nice animated line effect. We're really nice animated line effect. We're really nice animated line effect. We're going to solidify that topographic map going to solidify that topographic map going to solidify that topographic map inspiration and create a grid floor for inspiration and create a grid floor for inspiration and create a grid floor for the bottom and we'll be done. This the bottom and we'll be done. This the bottom and we'll be done. This animation is part of a series of animation is part of a series of animation is part of a series of tutorials here on YouTube that are tutorials here on YouTube that are tutorials here on YouTube that are inspired by topographic map art and inspired by topographic map art and inspired by topographic map art and animations. I'll be posting four of animations. I'll be posting four of animations. I'll be posting four of these tutorials backtoback here on these tutorials backtoback here on these tutorials backtoback here on YouTube. So, if you want to learn more YouTube.

With discount if you subscribe annually. With discount if you subscribe annually. With that being said, let's get into this that being said, let's get into this that being said, let's get into this tutorial. All right, so we are going to tutorial. All right, so we are going to tutorial. All right, so we are going to go ahead and I'm going to hop into the go ahead and I'm going to hop into the go ahead and I'm going to hop into the Geometry Notes workspace and just delete Geometry Notes workspace and just delete Geometry Notes workspace and just delete these windows. Just get it how I like these windows. Just get it how I like these windows. Just get it how I like it. Let's get a plane. Let's call it it. Let's get a plane. Let's call it it. Let's get a plane. Let's call it just going to call it geo. We're going just going to call it geo. We're going just going to call it geo. We're going to build the displacement and the tiling to build the displacement and the tiling to build the displacement and the tiling uh directly in geometry nodes. So, it uh directly in geometry nodes. So, it uh directly in geometry nodes. So, it should be really fun. So, we're going to should be really fun. So, we're going to should be really fun. So, we're going to click new. Let's go ahead and delete click new. Let's go ahead and delete click new. Let's go ahead and delete this. We're going to go ahead and get a this. We're going to go ahead and get a this. We're going to go ahead and get a get a grid. And then we're going to plug get a grid. And then we're going to plug get a grid. And then we're going to plug this right into here. And we're going to this right into here. And we're going to this right into here. And we're going to make it 40x 40. Really big. Uh really make it 40x 40. Really big. Uh really make it 40x 40. Really big. Uh really it's like 20 by 20. Then we can make the it's like 20 by 20. Then we can make the it's like 20 by 20. Then we can make the vertices at about vertices at about vertices at about 300 by 300. And that's going to give us 300 by 300. And that's going to give us 300 by 300. And that's going to give us a nice amount of subdivision for nice a nice amount of subdivision for nice a nice amount of subdivision for nice smooth displacement. So, speaking of smooth displacement. So, speaking of smooth displacement. So, speaking of displacement, we're going to get a set displacement, we're going to get a set displacement, we're going to get a set position node. Let's get a position node. Let's get a position node. Let's get a going to get a combined XYZ node. And going to get a combined XYZ node. And going to get a combined XYZ node. And we're going to plug a noise texture we're going to plug a noise texture we're going to plug a noise texture right into the Z. So, let's plug factor. right into the Z. So, let's plug factor. right into the Z. So, let's plug factor. Let's put color. We're going to switch Let's put color. We're going to switch Let's put color. We're going to switch to heterotrain and bring that scale up to heterotrain and bring that scale up to heterotrain and bring that scale up pretty nicely. And then let's get a pretty nicely. And then let's get a pretty nicely. And then let's get a vector math node. vector math node. vector math node. This vector math node is going to allow This vector math node is going to allow This vector math node is going to allow us to adjust the strength of the us to adjust the strength of the us to adjust the strength of the displacement. So, if we bring it all the displacement. So, if we bring it all the displacement. So, if we bring it all the way down here to scale, we can do way down here to scale, we can do way down here to scale, we can do something like this. Now, I need some something like this. Now, I need some something like this. Now, I need some flat portions to give it that that uh flat portions to give it that that uh flat portions to give it that that uh topographic map uh look. So, the way topographic map uh look. So, the way topographic map uh look. So, the way we're going to do that is with a RGB we're going to do that is with a RGB we're going to do that is with a RGB curves node. So, get an RGB curves node. curves node. So, get an RGB curves node. curves node. So, get an RGB curves node. We're going to zoom in here. We're going We're going to zoom in here. We're going We're going to zoom in here. We're going to add just a point right about here and to add just a point right about here and to add just a point right about here and a point here and a point here. And then a point here and a point here. And then a point here and a point here. And then bring this up. And that's going to bring this up. And that's going to bring this up. And that's going to flatten it uh pretty dramatically. So we flatten it uh pretty dramatically. So we flatten it uh pretty dramatically. So we can bring this down like that can bring this down like that can bring this down like that until we have some flat portions. But it until we have some flat portions. But it until we have some flat portions. But it doesn't need to be super super flat. doesn't need to be super super flat. doesn't need to be super super flat. What I don't want is things jutting down What I don't want is things jutting down What I don't want is things jutting down too far cuz if we do this, see that? So too far cuz if we do this, see that? So too far cuz if we do this, see that? So we're kind of killing we're kind of killing we're kind of killing that effect. And then we can bring the that effect. And then we can bring the that effect. And then we can bring the scale back up. And then obviously we can scale back up. And then obviously we can scale back up. And then obviously we can bring the uh scale of the noise however bring the uh scale of the noise however bring the uh scale of the noise however we want that to look. And we can adjust we want that to look. And we can adjust we want that to look. And we can adjust this um plenty later. Let's get a this um plenty later. Let's get a this um plenty later. Let's get a set shade smooth node. And we're going set shade smooth node. And we're going set shade smooth node. And we're going to go ahead to go ahead to go ahead and actually I'm going to highlight and actually I'm going to highlight and actually I'm going to highlight these, hit G, and get more space. Let's these, hit G, and get more space. Let's these, hit G, and get more space. Let's go ahead and tile our uh displacement so go ahead and tile our uh displacement so go ahead and tile our uh displacement so that this loop uh this animation can that this loop uh this animation can that this loop uh this animation can loop seamlessly. So what we're going to loop seamlessly. So what we're going to loop seamlessly. So what we're going to do is get a transform geometry node. do is get a transform geometry node. do is get a transform geometry node. a join geometry node and then plug the a join geometry node and then plug the a join geometry node and then plug the set position into the join and this guy set position into the join and this guy set position into the join and this guy is now a duplicate. So we can go I know is now a duplicate. So we can go I know is now a duplicate. So we can go I know this guy is 40 by 40. So if I just go this guy is 40 by 40. So if I just go this guy is 40 by 40. So if I just go ahead and move this on the Y or the X by ahead and move this on the Y or the X by ahead and move this on the Y or the X by 40, 40, 40, it is going to bring it exactly one it is going to bring it exactly one it is going to bring it exactly one space over. And if we chose to move it space over. And if we chose to move it space over. And if we chose to move it on the X, let's go here on the X scale on the X, let's go here on the X scale on the X, let's go here on the X scale and give it -1. And that creates a and give it -1. And that creates a and give it -1. And that creates a mirror that we can then tile this. So mirror that we can then tile this. So mirror that we can then tile this. So let's go ahead and get another transform let's go ahead and get another transform let's go ahead and get another transform geometry node geometry node geometry node and another join geometry and plug the and another join geometry and plug the and another join geometry and plug the join into the join. Again, he is a join into the join. Again, he is a join into the join. Again, he is a duplicate. So then we can bring this duplicate. So then we can bring this duplicate. So then we can bring this down. And looks like it needs to be down. And looks like it needs to be down. And looks like it needs to be what? 80. Yeah, 80 on the X. And now we what? 80. Yeah, 80 on the X. And now we what? 80. Yeah, 80 on the X. And now we have have have something that is uh going to be able to something that is uh going to be able to something that is uh going to be able to once we run the camera down loopable once we run the camera down loopable once we run the camera down loopable seamlessly. So let's go ahead and seamlessly. So let's go ahead and seamlessly. So let's go ahead and actually animate that camera. So I'm actually animate that camera. So I'm actually animate that camera. So I'm just going to position my viewport just going to position my viewport just going to position my viewport wherever I want the relative camera wherever I want the relative camera wherever I want the relative camera position to be. So something like this. position to be. So something like this. position to be. So something like this. We'll go right about here. I'm going hit We'll go right about here. I'm going hit We'll go right about here. I'm going hit shift A and then get a uh if I can find shift A and then get a uh if I can find shift A and then get a uh if I can find it camera control alt0 we'll snap it to it camera control alt0 we'll snap it to it camera control alt0 we'll snap it to view and then I'm going to hit the tilda key and then I'm going to hit the tilda key and then I'm going to hit the tilda key and I'm going to look at the position of and I'm going to look at the position of and I'm going to look at the position of my camera. He needs to be at the very my camera. He needs to be at the very my camera. He needs to be at the very edge of this geometry here. So I know my edge of this geometry here. So I know my edge of this geometry here. So I know my camera needs to be moving on the X and camera needs to be moving on the X and camera needs to be moving on the X and so looks like it needs to be -20 so looks like it needs to be -20 so looks like it needs to be -20 because that's how big this is. This is because that's how big this is. This is because that's how big this is. This is 40x 40 which means in kind of real space 40x 40 which means in kind of real space 40x 40 which means in kind of real space it's 20 by 20. So now I can look at my it's 20 by 20. So now I can look at my it's 20 by 20. So now I can look at my camera and we can go ahead and animate. camera and we can go ahead and animate. camera and we can go ahead and animate. So first I'm just going to go ahead So first I'm just going to go ahead So first I'm just going to go ahead click on my camera going to rotate it a click on my camera going to rotate it a click on my camera going to rotate it a little bit. little bit. little bit. Something like that. And then I'm going Something like that. And then I'm going Something like that. And then I'm going to hit and then I'm going to zoom it in to hit and then I'm going to zoom it in to hit and then I'm going to zoom it in a little bit on the millimeters so that a little bit on the millimeters so that a little bit on the millimeters so that all of my geometry is filling my screen. all of my geometry is filling my screen. all of my geometry is filling my screen. So let's go ahead and create this So let's go ahead and create this So let's go ahead and create this animation. I'm going to give myself animation. I'm going to give myself animation. I'm going to give myself 600 frames. I'm going to go back to 600 frames. I'm going to go back to 600 frames. I'm going to go back to frame one and make sure in your frame one and make sure in your frame one and make sure in your preferences in the animation, your preferences in the animation, your preferences in the animation, your default interpolation is linear. So, we default interpolation is linear. So, we default interpolation is linear. So, we can look at this from the tilt key uh can look at this from the tilt key uh can look at this from the tilt key uh the top view here. I'm looking at my the top view here. I'm looking at my the top view here. I'm looking at my camera. We'll go to the settings here. camera. We'll go to the settings here. camera. We'll go to the settings here. Make sure you are again at frame zero. Make sure you are again at frame zero. Make sure you are again at frame zero. Right here on the X, make sure he is at Right here on the X, make sure he is at Right here on the X, make sure he is at 20. 20. 20. Hit the key frame and go to the very end Hit the key frame and go to the very end Hit the key frame and go to the very end to frame 600. And I know that he needs to frame 600. And I know that he needs to frame 600. And I know that he needs to be to be to be see this seam right here. Skip this see this seam right here. Skip this see this seam right here. Skip this seam. And you need to stop it at this seam. And you need to stop it at this seam. And you need to stop it at this seam. So I'm going to go back to my seam. So I'm going to go back to my seam. So I'm going to go back to my camera and just eyeball that. So I'm camera and just eyeball that. So I'm camera and just eyeball that. So I'm going to go ahead hold down control and going to go ahead hold down control and going to go ahead hold down control and go all the way to that seam, which is go all the way to that seam, which is go all the way to that seam, which is going to be 60. So if you just want to going to be 60. So if you just want to going to be 60. So if you just want to type in, go to the end of your timeline, type in, go to the end of your timeline, type in, go to the end of your timeline, type in 60, hit the key frame, you are type in 60, hit the key frame, you are type in 60, hit the key frame, you are going to be exactly where you need to going to be exactly where you need to going to be exactly where you need to be. So, I'm going to bring my We can see be. So, I'm going to bring my We can see be. So, I'm going to bring my We can see we can see. Let's make sure this loops we can see. Let's make sure this loops we can see. Let's make sure this loops seamlessly. So, once he gets to the end seamlessly. So, once he gets to the end seamlessly. So, once he gets to the end and restarts, it will look seamless. So, and restarts, it will look seamless. So, and restarts, it will look seamless. So, I'm going to press play. I'm going to press play. I'm going to press play. Go to the end. Perfect. This is a Go to the end. Perfect. This is a Go to the end. Perfect. This is a perfect seamless loop. So, now we can perfect seamless loop. So, now we can perfect seamless loop. So, now we can focus on uh the shading of this focus on uh the shading of this focus on uh the shading of this animation. So, I'm going to bring my animation. So, I'm going to bring my animation. So, I'm going to bring my detail down a little bit on these hills detail down a little bit on these hills detail down a little bit on these hills and maybe flatten a few things out here. and maybe flatten a few things out here. and maybe flatten a few things out here. Something like this. Something like this. Something like this. Bring my scale up. Bring my scale up. Bring my scale up. Bring my strength up. There we go. Have Bring my strength up. There we go. Have Bring my strength up. There we go. Have a little bit of fun. So, let's go ahead a little bit of fun. So, let's go ahead a little bit of fun. So, let's go ahead and add some shading. So, right over and add some shading. So, right over and add some shading. So, right over here, let's go ahead and get a shader, a here, let's go ahead and get a shader, a here, let's go ahead and get a shader, a emission, and then we can go over here, emission, and then we can go over here, emission, and then we can go over here, get a get a get a set material node, and grab that. And set material node, and grab that. And set material node, and grab that. And then let's head over to shading. I'm then let's head over to shading. I'm then let's head over to shading. I'm going to go ahead and get my windows the going to go ahead and get my windows the going to go ahead and get my windows the way I want them to be. So, this one way I want them to be. So, this one way I want them to be. So, this one being the 3D viewport, this one being being the 3D viewport, this one being being the 3D viewport, this one being the shader editor. So, first let's go the shader editor. So, first let's go the shader editor. So, first let's go ahead and let's get a color ramp. Plug ahead and let's get a color ramp. Plug ahead and let's get a color ramp. Plug this into here. I'm going to hit I'm this into here. I'm going to hit I'm this into here. I'm going to hit I'm going to hit CtrlT. I'm going to go over going to hit CtrlT. I'm going to go over going to hit CtrlT. I'm going to go over the factor I mean over the image texture the factor I mean over the image texture the factor I mean over the image texture and use the object coordinate. And then and use the object coordinate. And then and use the object coordinate. And then I'm going to get a separate XYZ and I'm I'm going to get a separate XYZ and I'm I'm going to get a separate XYZ and I'm going to define it to the Z so that we going to define it to the Z so that we going to define it to the Z so that we can start to see this uh gradient can start to see this uh gradient can start to see this uh gradient working. Next thing I want to do, you working. Next thing I want to do, you working. Next thing I want to do, you can also, you can control it here. can also, you can control it here. can also, you can control it here. What I want to do before the color ramp What I want to do before the color ramp What I want to do before the color ramp is get a map range. And the map range is is get a map range. And the map range is is get a map range. And the map range is going to give us a really cool effect. going to give us a really cool effect. going to give us a really cool effect. So, I'm going to go here, go from linear So, I'm going to go here, go from linear So, I'm going to go here, go from linear to stepped linear. And that's going to to stepped linear. And that's going to to stepped linear. And that's going to give us these really cool steps that we give us these really cool steps that we give us these really cool steps that we can use uh to make this look really can use uh to make this look really can use uh to make this look really awesome. Now if you want to move the awesome. Now if you want to move the awesome. Now if you want to move the gradient up, you can get another math gradient up, you can get another math gradient up, you can get another math node node node and use the value to bring it up like and use the value to bring it up like and use the value to bring it up like that. You can bring it down. So all it's all You can bring it down. So all it's all You can bring it down. So all it's all completely up to you. Here in the color completely up to you. Here in the color completely up to you. Here in the color ramp, you can go ahead and define ramp, you can go ahead and define ramp, you can go ahead and define whatever color you want this to be. So whatever color you want this to be. So whatever color you want this to be. So we're going to go ahead and say maybe we're going to go ahead and say maybe we're going to go ahead and say maybe maybe a nice green. Something like this. maybe a nice green. Something like this. maybe a nice green. Something like this. And then this black portion is going to And then this black portion is going to And then this black portion is going to be transparency. So let's go ahead and be transparency. So let's go ahead and be transparency. So let's go ahead and get in a mix shader. Get a transparent get in a mix shader. Get a transparent get in a mix shader. Get a transparent BSDF. Plug that here. And you're going BSDF. Plug that here. And you're going BSDF. Plug that here. And you're going to see this really grainy transparency. to see this really grainy transparency. to see this really grainy transparency. So here in the camera uh the camera So here in the camera uh the camera So here in the camera uh the camera icon, I'm going to go here to Eevee. icon, I'm going to go here to Eevee. icon, I'm going to go here to Eevee. Back to shading. You're going to see Back to shading. You're going to see Back to shading. You're going to see dithered. Blended is going to give you dithered. Blended is going to give you dithered. Blended is going to give you that nice smooth um transparency. Now that nice smooth um transparency. Now that nice smooth um transparency. Now we'll put our world brightness to black. we'll put our world brightness to black. we'll put our world brightness to black. And then we can throw some stuff here on And then we can throw some stuff here on And then we can throw some stuff here on the bottom. But now we can go ahead and the bottom. But now we can go ahead and the bottom. But now we can go ahead and say get another color ramp say get another color ramp say get another color ramp and define our transparency. So plug and define our transparency. So plug and define our transparency. So plug plug the map range into the color a ramp plug the map range into the color a ramp plug the map range into the color a ramp and the color a ramp into the factor. and the color a ramp into the factor. and the color a ramp into the factor. And then we're going to flip the color And then we're going to flip the color And then we're going to flip the color ramp. So now what's under this is going ramp. So now what's under this is going ramp. So now what's under this is going to be transparent. You can kind of see to be transparent. You can kind of see to be transparent. You can kind of see it working. You can see through. The it working. You can see through. The it working. You can see through. The darker it is, the more you can see darker it is, the more you can see darker it is, the more you can see through it. So that's great. Now you'll through it. So that's great. Now you'll through it. So that's great. Now you'll notice how it's like all white up here. notice how it's like all white up here. notice how it's like all white up here. There's no definition. You can take the There's no definition. You can take the There's no definition. You can take the from max and bring it up a little bit from max and bring it up a little bit from max and bring it up a little bit and that is going to allow a little bit and that is going to allow a little bit and that is going to allow a little bit more um a little bit more I can't think more um a little bit more I can't think more um a little bit more I can't think of the word not great with words today. of the word not great with words today. of the word not great with words today. Uh but it's going to help with that Uh but it's going to help with that Uh but it's going to help with that scale and that really interesting scale and that really interesting scale and that really interesting stepped look and not look so flat on the stepped look and not look so flat on the stepped look and not look so flat on the tops. Now let's go and add those tops. Now let's go and add those tops. Now let's go and add those blinking lines that are in the blinking lines that are in the blinking lines that are in the animation. And so we're going to go animation. And so we're going to go animation. And so we're going to go ahead get another mix shader and we're ahead get another mix shader and we're ahead get another mix shader and we're going to get a emission node. And I'm going to get a emission node. And I'm going to get a emission node. And I'm just going to go ahead and click on just going to go ahead and click on just going to go ahead and click on this. Hit Ctrl + C on this color. Ctrl this. Hit Ctrl + C on this color. Ctrl this. Hit Ctrl + C on this color. Ctrl +V on that color. Plug it here. And +V on that color. Plug it here. And +V on that color. Plug it here. And let's go ahead and get in a color ramp let's go ahead and get in a color ramp let's go ahead and get in a color ramp to create this. We're going to get a to create this. We're going to get a to create this. We're going to get a wave texture. And then we're going to wave texture. And then we're going to wave texture. And then we're going to get a brand. We're going to hit control get a brand. We're going to hit control get a brand. We're going to hit control T and get a brand new set of mapping T and get a brand new set of mapping T and get a brand new set of mapping nodes. Plug color here. And then we're nodes. Plug color here. And then we're nodes. Plug color here. And then we're going to switch from X to Z. and it's going to switch from X to Z. and it's going to switch from X to Z. and it's going to create this really interesting going to create this really interesting going to create this really interesting effect. We're going to we're going to go effect. We're going to we're going to go effect. We're going to we're going to go from linear to constant. from linear to constant. from linear to constant. But to make these lines even thinner, But to make these lines even thinner, But to make these lines even thinner, you can switch this over to saw. And you can switch this over to saw. And you can switch this over to saw. And that's going to allow a little bit more that's going to allow a little bit more that's going to allow a little bit more of a thin uh line look. And then you can of a thin uh line look. And then you can of a thin uh line look. And then you can just bring this up to see how many lines just bring this up to see how many lines just bring this up to see how many lines you want to to do. You can get it to you want to to do. You can get it to you want to to do. You can get it to line up with the steps. Um you don't line up with the steps. Um you don't line up with the steps. Um you don't have to obviously, but whatever you want have to obviously, but whatever you want have to obviously, but whatever you want to do, you can absolutely do. So you to do, you can absolutely do. So you to do, you can absolutely do. So you have this. Now remember, we can play have this. Now remember, we can play have this. Now remember, we can play with this thickness. So let's go ahead. with this thickness. So let's go ahead. with this thickness. So let's go ahead. We have the lines. I want to get them uh We have the lines. I want to get them uh We have the lines. I want to get them uh to be blinking in and out on the to be blinking in and out on the to be blinking in and out on the scene. So one thing I want to do is scene. So one thing I want to do is scene. So one thing I want to do is bring the emission strength down on the bring the emission strength down on the bring the emission strength down on the emi on this emission node down here so emi on this emission node down here so emi on this emission node down here so that we can see all of the lines and the that we can see all of the lines and the that we can see all of the lines and the lines being the brightest part of this lines being the brightest part of this lines being the brightest part of this animation. So here's a really really fun animation. So here's a really really fun animation. So here's a really really fun trick that I showed uh here on YouTube a trick that I showed uh here on YouTube a trick that I showed uh here on YouTube a while back. We're going to take this. while back. We're going to take this. while back. We're going to take this. I'm going to get a mix color. I'm going to get a mix color. I'm going to get a mix color. So, this is plugged into A. I'm going to So, this is plugged into A. I'm going to So, this is plugged into A. I'm going to hit control shift D. Again, that works hit control shift D. Again, that works hit control shift D. Again, that works if you have the node wrangler add-on if you have the node wrangler add-on if you have the node wrangler add-on enabled or just plug the wave texture enabled or just plug the wave texture enabled or just plug the wave texture into a new color ramp of a duplicate of into a new color ramp of a duplicate of into a new color ramp of a duplicate of this one. Plug it into here. So, here on this one. Plug it into here. So, here on this one. Plug it into here. So, here on this factor, I'm going to bring these this factor, I'm going to bring these this factor, I'm going to bring these lines to be as thin as possible on the lines to be as thin as possible on the lines to be as thin as possible on the color ramp. Bring the factor to the color ramp. Bring the factor to the color ramp. Bring the factor to the right. And we'll just make them a little right. And we'll just make them a little right. And we'll just make them a little thicker. thicker. thicker. And then, let's get another color ramp. And then, let's get another color ramp. And then, let's get another color ramp. I'm hit shift D and bring it to the I'm hit shift D and bring it to the I'm hit shift D and bring it to the middle. Control shift D on this wave middle. Control shift D on this wave middle. Control shift D on this wave texture just so that he's still plugged texture just so that he's still plugged texture just so that he's still plugged into the mapping. Plug it into there and into the mapping. Plug it into there and into the mapping. Plug it into there and then plug him into the factor. Once we then plug him into the factor. Once we then plug him into the factor. Once we get a smaller scale, so maybe 0.5, get a smaller scale, so maybe 0.5, get a smaller scale, so maybe 0.5, you're going to get this difference in you're going to get this difference in you're going to get this difference in thickness. And so it's using a wave thickness. And so it's using a wave thickness. And so it's using a wave texture to mask out um some of the texture to mask out um some of the texture to mask out um some of the thicker lines and the thinner lines. So thicker lines and the thinner lines. So thicker lines and the thinner lines. So you can have some fun you can have some fun you can have some fun with that. And it's really really cool. with that. And it's really really cool. with that. And it's really really cool. If you go to the compositing, I'm click If you go to the compositing, I'm click If you go to the compositing, I'm click use nodes. I'm going get a glare node use nodes. I'm going get a glare node use nodes. I'm going get a glare node set to fog glow. We'll go back to set to fog glow. We'll go back to set to fog glow. We'll go back to shading. And I'm going to hit this and shading. And I'm going to hit this and shading. And I'm going to hit this and click on always. What's going to happen click on always. What's going to happen click on always. What's going to happen is we can bring up when we get this is we can bring up when we get this is we can bring up when we get this emission node here. I'm going to bring emission node here. I'm going to bring emission node here. I'm going to bring up the brightness so that the thicker up the brightness so that the thicker up the brightness so that the thicker ones are going to glow. ones are going to glow. ones are going to glow. Then you play with the phase offset. And Then you play with the phase offset. And Then you play with the phase offset. And now you have this. Now, one thing I want now you have this. Now, one thing I want now you have this. Now, one thing I want to do is eliminate some of the lines to do is eliminate some of the lines to do is eliminate some of the lines down here. So, it's still topographic down here. So, it's still topographic down here. So, it's still topographic map looking. How am I going to do that? map looking. How am I going to do that? map looking. How am I going to do that? So, I'm going to hit G and move these So, I'm going to hit G and move these So, I'm going to hit G and move these over. This emission node is handling the over. This emission node is handling the over. This emission node is handling the lines. So, what I want to do is just get lines. So, what I want to do is just get lines. So, what I want to do is just get another mix shader. So, I'm going to another mix shader. So, I'm going to another mix shader. So, I'm going to give myself a little bit more space here give myself a little bit more space here give myself a little bit more space here just so it because it's going to start just so it because it's going to start just so it because it's going to start getting a little wild. We're going to getting a little wild. We're going to getting a little wild. We're going to get another transparent BSDF. You could get another transparent BSDF. You could get another transparent BSDF. You could just plug this one over here, but just just plug this one over here, but just just plug this one over here, but just to keep things visually in a good spot, to keep things visually in a good spot, to keep things visually in a good spot, I'm going to just get a new transparent I'm going to just get a new transparent I'm going to just get a new transparent node. What I want to do, I give myself node. What I want to do, I give myself node. What I want to do, I give myself some more space here, is get a color some more space here, is get a color some more space here, is get a color ramp ramp ramp so we can plug something into it. What I so we can plug something into it. What I so we can plug something into it. What I want to plug into it is the map range want to plug into it is the map range want to plug into it is the map range that is creating this gradient because that is creating this gradient because that is creating this gradient because we want to use a gradient to say kill we want to use a gradient to say kill we want to use a gradient to say kill some of these uh lines down here. some of these uh lines down here. some of these uh lines down here. So, I'm going to plug the map range So, I'm going to plug the map range So, I'm going to plug the map range into the color ramp. And then I'm just into the color ramp. And then I'm just into the color ramp. And then I'm just going to flip the color ramp. And as you going to flip the color ramp. And as you going to flip the color ramp. And as you can see, once we move the white one, it can see, once we move the white one, it can see, once we move the white one, it removes some of those. I'm going to use removes some of those. I'm going to use removes some of those. I'm going to use a constant offset so it's a little bit a constant offset so it's a little bit a constant offset so it's a little bit more precise. more precise. more precise. I just want like that big one on the I just want like that big one on the I just want like that big one on the bottom gone. So now when we go back to bottom gone. So now when we go back to bottom gone. So now when we go back to this top wave texture, this top wave texture, this top wave texture, it looks a little better in my opinion. it looks a little better in my opinion. it looks a little better in my opinion. So there we go. We are pretty much done So there we go. We are pretty much done So there we go. We are pretty much done with this animation. One thing I want to with this animation. One thing I want to with this animation. One thing I want to do do do is get a grid floor is get a grid floor is get a grid floor so it looks like that classic so it looks like that classic so it looks like that classic topographic maps uh vibe. So I'm going topographic maps uh vibe. So I'm going topographic maps uh vibe. So I'm going to get a plane and I'm going to hit S20. to get a plane and I'm going to hit S20. to get a plane and I'm going to hit S20. Hit control A, apply that scale. Then Hit control A, apply that scale. Then Hit control A, apply that scale. Then I'm going to hit Alt D holding down I'm going to hit Alt D holding down I'm going to hit Alt D holding down control and snapping each one to the control and snapping each one to the control and snapping each one to the edge. Alt D, holding down control, snap edge. Alt D, holding down control, snap edge. Alt D, holding down control, snap it to the edge. Alt D. it to the edge. Alt D. it to the edge. Alt D. There we go. So now I'm going to take There we go. So now I'm going to take There we go. So now I'm going to take this, bring it up so that the the plane this, bring it up so that the the plane this, bring it up so that the the plane isn't connecting to the bottom. Select isn't connecting to the bottom. Select isn't connecting to the bottom. Select this bottom plane. Now the reason why we this bottom plane. Now the reason why we this bottom plane. Now the reason why we did alt D is when we add a material to did alt D is when we add a material to did alt D is when we add a material to this plane, it's going to add it to this plane, it's going to add it to this plane, it's going to add it to those planes, too, because they are those planes, too, because they are those planes, too, because they are instances. So let's head back to instances. So let's head back to instances. So let's head back to shading. I'm going to click new. I'm shading. I'm going to click new. I'm shading. I'm going to click new. I'm going hit period to bring up that going hit period to bring up that going hit period to bring up that principled emission. We're just going to principled emission. We're just going to principled emission. We're just going to give it a strength of like three. So give it a strength of like three. So give it a strength of like three. So yep, we can see it through our yep, we can see it through our yep, we can see it through our mountains. mountains. mountains. Let's get a color ramp. Let's get a color ramp. Let's get a color ramp. plug it here. And then I'm going to plug it here. And then I'm going to plug it here. And then I'm going to click on the mountains. I'm just going click on the mountains. I'm just going click on the mountains. I'm just going to copy this color. And then click back to copy this color. And then click back to copy this color. And then click back on this bottom plane, paste it there. on this bottom plane, paste it there. on this bottom plane, paste it there. We're going to get a Voronoi texture. We're going to get a Voronoi texture. We're going to get a Voronoi texture. Hit CtrlT. And use the object coordinate Hit CtrlT. And use the object coordinate Hit CtrlT. And use the object coordinate distance here. Bring the randomness in. distance here. Bring the randomness in. distance here. Bring the randomness in. And we're going to go from uklidian to And we're going to go from uklidian to And we're going to go from uklidian to chvy. chvy. chvy. Bring that scale to like Bring that scale to like Bring that scale to like three. We're going to go from linear to three. We're going to go from linear to three. We're going to go from linear to constant. constant. constant. Where's our grid? There it is. And then Where's our grid? There it is. And then Where's our grid? There it is. And then we're going to try to make our grid as we're going to try to make our grid as we're going to try to make our grid as thin thin thin as possible. There we go. And what I as possible. There we go. And what I as possible. There we go. And what I like to do like to do like to do is actually I'm going to se select all is actually I'm going to se select all is actually I'm going to se select all of these planes by holding down shift of these planes by holding down shift of these planes by holding down shift and I'm going to bring them down so that and I'm going to bring them down so that and I'm going to bring them down so that there's a parallax effect. So I'm going there's a parallax effect. So I'm going there's a parallax effect. So I'm going to bring them over. So when I press to bring them over. So when I press to bring them over. So when I press play, play, play, you can see it kind of looks like the you can see it kind of looks like the you can see it kind of looks like the mountains are moving faster than that mountains are moving faster than that mountains are moving faster than that bottom grid. So it's going to create bottom grid. So it's going to create bottom grid. So it's going to create this really, really cool, quite subtle this really, really cool, quite subtle this really, really cool, quite subtle parallax effect. And then I'm just going parallax effect. And then I'm just going parallax effect. And then I'm just going to bring down the brightness of the grid to bring down the brightness of the grid to bring down the brightness of the grid on the bottom. on the bottom. on the bottom. And now if I press play, And now if I press play, And now if I press play, it has this really cool effect. Last it has this really cool effect. Last it has this really cool effect. Last thing we need to do is animate thing we need to do is animate thing we need to do is animate the phase offset here. So, I'm going to the phase offset here. So, I'm going to the phase offset here. So, I'm going to give myself a timeline. give myself a timeline. give myself a timeline. I have 600 frames. I have 600 frames. I have 600 frames. So, I'm just going to give myself some So, I'm just going to give myself some So, I'm just going to give myself some space for this timeline. Go back to space for this timeline. Go back to space for this timeline. Go back to frame zero. And to get the phase offset frame zero. And to get the phase offset frame zero. And to get the phase offset of a wave texture to loop, you have to of a wave texture to loop, you have to of a wave texture to loop, you have to use pi. So, if you've never done it, use pi. So, if you've never done it, use pi. So, if you've never done it, it's extremely easy. Hit I, go to the it's extremely easy. Hit I, go to the it's extremely easy. Hit I, go to the very end, and I'm going to type in 10. very end, and I'm going to type in 10. very end, and I'm going to type in 10. You need to use an even number. 10 times You need to use an even number. 10 times You need to use an even number. 10 times or asterisk pi. or asterisk pi. or asterisk pi. And that's really slow. So I'm going to And that's really slow. So I'm going to And that's really slow. So I'm going to do maybe do maybe do maybe 30 asterisk pi. Hit I. 30 asterisk pi. Hit I. 30 asterisk pi. Hit I. There we go. And we now have in fact let's make it even faster. So in fact let's make it even faster. So in fact let's make it even faster. So we'll do I don't know we'll do I don't know we'll do I don't know 40 asterisk pi 40 asterisk pi 40 asterisk pi hit I hit I hit I and then I'm going to play with the and then I'm going to play with the and then I'm going to play with the scale. The smaller the value of the wave, the The smaller the value of the wave, the The smaller the value of the wave, the smoother this effect is going to look. smoother this effect is going to look. smoother this effect is going to look. So like this is pretty cool and So like this is pretty cool and So like this is pretty cool and dramatic. dramatic. dramatic. And I And I And I I think this is really really really I think this is really really really I think this is really really really cool. cool. cool. And this is how you create this And this is how you create this And this is how you create this animation. Super fun, super cool, super animation. Super fun, super cool, super animation. Super fun, super cool, super easy. What we can do now is just go easy. What we can do now is just go easy. What we can do now is just go ahead and export it. So, I'm going to ahead and export it. So, I'm going to ahead and export it. So, I'm going to use 1920 x 1080. I highly recommend use 1920 x 1080. I highly recommend use 1920 x 1080. I highly recommend using a PNG sequence. Just pick a using a PNG sequence. Just pick a using a PNG sequence. Just pick a folder. Just pick your folder, send it folder. Just pick your folder, send it folder. Just pick your folder, send it in there, and uh compile it. If you in there, and uh compile it. If you in there, and uh compile it. If you don't want to do that, you can do FFmpeg don't want to do that, you can do FFmpeg don't want to do that, you can do FFmpeg video encoding to MP4 or QuickTime if video encoding to MP4 or QuickTime if video encoding to MP4 or QuickTime if you're on Mac. and then medium quality you're on Mac. and then medium quality you're on Mac. and then medium quality to perceptually lossless render render to perceptually lossless render render to perceptually lossless render render animation. And when you're done, you'll animation. And when you're done, you'll animation. And when you're done, you'll have something really cool like mine. have something really cool like mine. have something really cool like mine. So, thank you for watching.
