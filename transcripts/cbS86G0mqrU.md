There's hundreds of directions you can There's hundreds of directions you can There's hundreds of directions you can go uh in 3D if you want to take logos go uh in 3D if you want to take logos go uh in 3D if you want to take logos and bring them to life because at the and bring them to life because at the and bring them to life because at the end of the day we're playing with end of the day we're playing with end of the day we're playing with geometry. It's just in the shape of a geometry. It's just in the shape of a geometry. It's just in the shape of a logo. But this week I wanted to take six logo. But this week I wanted to take six logo. But this week I wanted to take six ideas and make something really cool ideas and make something really cool ideas and make something really cool with them. Ended up making some really with them. Ended up making some really with them. Ended up making some really cool animations and a couple still cool animations and a couple still cool animations and a couple still images. So, what I want to do today is images. So, what I want to do today is images. So, what I want to do today is show you the bones, the concept of how show you the bones, the concept of how show you the bones, the concept of how to do those processes in Blender and to do those processes in Blender and to do those processes in Blender and just show you enough to where you can just show you enough to where you can just show you enough to where you can take them and then make them your own take them and then make them your own take them and then make them your own with your own ideas and how to take with your own ideas and how to take with your own ideas and how to take those ideas and go further with them those ideas and go further with them those ideas and go further with them with your own creativity. The first with your own creativity. The first with your own creativity. The first concept is taking your geometry, concept is taking your geometry, concept is taking your geometry, converting it to a volume so that you converting it to a volume so that you converting it to a volume so that you can then displace it in really cool ways can then displace it in really cool ways can then displace it in really cool ways that goes beyond your typical that goes beyond your typical that goes beyond your typical displacement modifier. and then we're displacement modifier. and then we're displacement modifier. and then we're going to convert it back into geometry going to convert it back into geometry going to convert it back into geometry so that you can add materials, lighting, so that you can add materials, lighting, so that you can add materials, lighting, anything you want to do it past that. anything you want to do it past that. anything you want to do it past that. The second one is conceptually very The second one is conceptually very The second one is conceptually very simple. You're taking just an image of simple. You're taking just an image of simple. You're taking just an image of your logo, black and white, throwing it your logo, black and white, throwing it your logo, black and white, throwing it in Blender, and manipulating it with in Blender, and manipulating it with in Blender, and manipulating it with procedural textures to create this procedural textures to create this procedural textures to create this transitioning morphing effect with transitioning morphing effect with transitioning morphing effect with anything you want to do. It's very anything you want to do. It's very anything you want to do. It's very powerful, but very simple to execute. powerful, but very simple to execute. powerful, but very simple to execute. This might be my favorite one. Uh, but This might be my favorite one. Uh, but This might be my favorite one. Uh, but we're taking a logo and able to control we're taking a logo and able to control we're taking a logo and able to control the emission outwards and inwards the emission outwards and inwards the emission outwards and inwards independently to make a really cool independently to make a really cool independently to make a really cool animation. Fourth concept is just being animation. Fourth concept is just being animation. Fourth concept is just being able to fill the inside of your logo able to fill the inside of your logo able to fill the inside of your logo with objects. I'm going to show you two with objects. I'm going to show you two with objects. I'm going to show you two methods. One that helps you fill it methods. One that helps you fill it methods. One that helps you fill it really well. Another method that allows really well. Another method that allows really well. Another method that allows you some space to animate those points. you some space to animate those points. you some space to animate those points. Then I'm going to show you how to take Then I'm going to show you how to take Then I'm going to show you how to take the black and white image of a logo, use the black and white image of a logo, use the black and white image of a logo, use it as a mask in geometry node. So, we it as a mask in geometry node. So, we it as a mask in geometry node. So, we can delete things, scale things, really can delete things, scale things, really can delete things, scale things, really show you how to take an image, map it in show you how to take an image, map it in show you how to take an image, map it in Geometry Nodes, and then you can take Geometry Nodes, and then you can take Geometry Nodes, and then you can take your further Geometry Nodes knowledge to your further Geometry Nodes knowledge to your further Geometry Nodes knowledge to do whatever you want under that idea. do whatever you want under that idea. do whatever you want under that idea. And the last one, I'm going to show you And the last one, I'm going to show you And the last one, I'm going to show you the quickest way to add fur to a logo the quickest way to add fur to a logo the quickest way to add fur to a logo and make it look really good very, very and make it look really good very, very and make it look really good very, very quickly. So, we're going to get into all quickly. So, we're going to get into all quickly. So, we're going to get into all of those right now. Before that, I want of those right now. Before that, I want of those right now. Before that, I want to let you guys know that there are six to let you guys know that there are six to let you guys know that there are six completed step-by-step tutorials on all completed step-by-step tutorials on all completed step-by-step tutorials on all of these concepts on my Patreon right of these concepts on my Patreon right of these concepts on my Patreon right now. I get to slow down, show you each now. I get to slow down, show you each now. I get to slow down, show you each one of these ideas in depth, and really one of these ideas in depth, and really one of these ideas in depth, and really show you how to make something really show you how to make something really show you how to make something really awesome by the end of them. If you want awesome by the end of them. If you want awesome by the end of them. If you want to check that out, that is on my Patreon to check that out, that is on my Patreon to check that out, that is on my Patreon today, and you can get a discount if you today, and you can get a discount if you today, and you can get a discount if you subscribe annually. With that being subscribe annually. With that being subscribe annually. With that being said, let's get into these concepts. said, let's get into these concepts. said, let's get into these concepts. Okay, so concept one, taking geometry, Okay, so concept one, taking geometry, Okay, so concept one, taking geometry, converting it to volumes, and being able converting it to volumes, and being able converting it to volumes, and being able to displace and sort of manipulate it to displace and sort of manipulate it to displace and sort of manipulate it that way. First, we are going to need that way. First, we are going to need that way. First, we are going to need the SVG of a logo. Um, but what you'll the SVG of a logo. Um, but what you'll the SVG of a logo. Um, but what you'll do is you just import and click on SVG. do is you just import and click on SVG. do is you just import and click on SVG. And I'm going to grab the Blender logo. And I'm going to grab the Blender logo. And I'm going to grab the Blender logo. So, we have the logo. First thing we So, we have the logo. First thing we So, we have the logo. First thing we need to do is add some thickness to it. need to do is add some thickness to it. need to do is add some thickness to it. Because it is currently a curve, you can Because it is currently a curve, you can Because it is currently a curve, you can go ahead in the geometry section and go ahead in the geometry section and go ahead in the geometry section and extrude that. And this is all we're extrude that. And this is all we're extrude that. And this is all we're going to need to do. And I'm just going going to need to do. And I'm just going going to need to do. And I'm just going to go ahead and convert it to a mesh. to go ahead and convert it to a mesh. to go ahead and convert it to a mesh. Now, we have real geometry. Now, I'm Now, we have real geometry. Now, I'm Now, we have real geometry. Now, I'm going to hide that. And the first step going to hide that. And the first step going to hide that. And the first step to converting this into a volume is in to converting this into a volume is in to converting this into a volume is in the volume settings, go ahead and create the volume settings, go ahead and create the volume settings, go ahead and create an empty. And that is going to give you an empty. And that is going to give you an empty. And that is going to give you a subset of modifiers you now have a subset of modifiers you now have a subset of modifiers you now have access to. We can search up a mesh to access to. We can search up a mesh to access to. We can search up a mesh to volume node and then you can grab that volume node and then you can grab that volume node and then you can grab that logo and you can start to see it show logo and you can start to see it show logo and you can start to see it show up. You bring up that density and then up. You bring up that density and then up. You bring up that density and then you can bring up that voxil amount. We you can bring up that voxil amount. We you can bring up that voxil amount. We now have a volume version of the logo now have a volume version of the logo now have a volume version of the logo and if you are in cycles you quite and if you are in cycles you quite and if you are in cycles you quite literally have now a volume version of literally have now a volume version of literally have now a volume version of this logo. Like already this is a cool this logo. Like already this is a cool this logo. Like already this is a cool concept. Now we're going to get a volume concept. Now we're going to get a volume concept. Now we're going to get a volume displace. So search that up. Volume displace. So search that up. Volume displace. So search that up. Volume displace. This is going to allow you to displace. This is going to allow you to displace. This is going to allow you to now throw textures on this just like a now throw textures on this just like a now throw textures on this just like a displacement texture. So, we'll go into displacement texture. So, we'll go into displacement texture. So, we'll go into the textures and I'm going to do the textures and I'm going to do the textures and I'm going to do distorted noise. And we now have this. distorted noise. And we now have this. distorted noise. And we now have this. Again, if we pop back into cycles, it's Again, if we pop back into cycles, it's Again, if we pop back into cycles, it's pretty cool. Now, keep in mind your pretty cool. Now, keep in mind your pretty cool. Now, keep in mind your voxil amount. I have it at 500, which is voxil amount. I have it at 500, which is voxil amount. I have it at 500, which is way too much just to show you guys way too much just to show you guys way too much just to show you guys what's going on. Let me just pop it down what's going on. Let me just pop it down what's going on. Let me just pop it down to 200. We can go ahead and play with to 200. We can go ahead and play with to 200. We can go ahead and play with that size. The strength is quite a that size. The strength is quite a that size. The strength is quite a lot right now. So, we'll maybe bring it lot right now. So, we'll maybe bring it lot right now. So, we'll maybe bring it down to something like this. Now what I down to something like this. Now what I down to something like this. Now what I can do is convert it back to geometry. can do is convert it back to geometry. can do is convert it back to geometry. So what we'll do is we'll just add a So what we'll do is we'll just add a So what we'll do is we'll just add a geometry nodes modifier and then open geometry nodes modifier and then open geometry nodes modifier and then open that up and then there is a volume to that up and then there is a volume to that up and then there is a volume to mesh node. Volume to mesh that is going mesh node. Volume to mesh that is going mesh node. Volume to mesh that is going to convert it back. It looks pretty to convert it back. It looks pretty to convert it back. It looks pretty insane. We can fix that with a set shade insane. We can fix that with a set shade insane. We can fix that with a set shade smooth node. And then you can see it's smooth node. And then you can see it's smooth node. And then you can see it's still kind of steppy if that's a proper still kind of steppy if that's a proper still kind of steppy if that's a proper word. I'm gonna bring my voxil amount to word. I'm gonna bring my voxil amount to word. I'm gonna bring my voxil amount to like 400. You could see that. I think like 400. You could see that. I think like 400. You could see that. I think it's cool, but it's not on purpose. So, it's cool, but it's not on purpose. So, it's cool, but it's not on purpose. So, you just bring that threshold up. Then you just bring that threshold up. Then you just bring that threshold up. Then you can head back to the texture and you can head back to the texture and you can head back to the texture and start to just play with some stuff. Uh I start to just play with some stuff. Uh I start to just play with some stuff. Uh I would play with the contrast would play with the contrast would play with the contrast specifically cuz I want to get these specifically cuz I want to get these specifically cuz I want to get these holes in uh the scene. And then you can holes in uh the scene. And then you can holes in uh the scene. And then you can maybe bring that size up. And now you maybe bring that size up. And now you maybe bring that size up. And now you have something really really wild. I have something really really wild. I have something really really wild. I find this volumeing and then texturing find this volumeing and then texturing find this volumeing and then texturing uh to be very stable. And I really uh to be very stable. And I really uh to be very stable. And I really really like this method. And you can really like this method. And you can really like this method. And you can throw any texture within this on that. throw any texture within this on that. throw any texture within this on that. So you can even mix them. We'll do maybe So you can even mix them. We'll do maybe So you can even mix them. We'll do maybe do a cell noise. And now we have this do a cell noise. And now we have this do a cell noise. And now we have this very quickly. And it's it's pretty very quickly. And it's it's pretty very quickly. And it's it's pretty stable. You have like weird things like stable. You have like weird things like stable. You have like weird things like this, but you can work with it. But that this, but you can work with it. But that this, but you can work with it. But that is how you can create something really is how you can create something really is how you can create something really really cool very quickly. Uh with really cool very quickly. Uh with really cool very quickly. Uh with volumes. For this next thing, you are volumes. For this next thing, you are volumes. For this next thing, you are going to need a black and white image of going to need a black and white image of going to need a black and white image of your logo. Something like this. I'm your logo. Something like this. I'm your logo. Something like this. I'm going to use uh the Nike logo. Um, but going to use uh the Nike logo. Um, but going to use uh the Nike logo. Um, but get a PNG or JPEG of a black and white get a PNG or JPEG of a black and white get a PNG or JPEG of a black and white image. Um, what we'll do now is I'm image. Um, what we'll do now is I'm image. Um, what we'll do now is I'm going to go ahead on image mesh plane going to go ahead on image mesh plane going to go ahead on image mesh plane and I'm going to grab my logo. So, I'm and I'm going to grab my logo. So, I'm and I'm going to grab my logo. So, I'm going to scale it up and we're going to going to scale it up and we're going to going to scale it up and we're going to open up a shader window and I'm going to open up a shader window and I'm going to open up a shader window and I'm going to look at this in Eevee. So, now we have look at this in Eevee. So, now we have look at this in Eevee. So, now we have this and we have a couple things that we this and we have a couple things that we this and we have a couple things that we can do here. So, I'm just going to go can do here. So, I'm just going to go can do here. So, I'm just going to go ahead and sever these connections. Give ahead and sever these connections. Give ahead and sever these connections. Give myself an emission of 10 and we're going myself an emission of 10 and we're going myself an emission of 10 and we're going to plug this guy right into color. And to plug this guy right into color. And to plug this guy right into color. And off the bat, we need to invert it. So, off the bat, we need to invert it. So, off the bat, we need to invert it. So, first you have some ugliness right first you have some ugliness right first you have some ugliness right there. You can fix there. You can fix there. You can fix that with a color ramp set to constant. that with a color ramp set to constant. that with a color ramp set to constant. That's going to fix that weird ugliness. That's going to fix that weird ugliness. That's going to fix that weird ugliness. Can't explain it, but that is the case. Can't explain it, but that is the case. Can't explain it, but that is the case. So, here's what we can do. Go ahead and So, here's what we can do. Go ahead and So, here's what we can do. Go ahead and get a mapping setup. Just a mapping node get a mapping setup. Just a mapping node get a mapping setup. Just a mapping node and a texture coordinate. And we are and a texture coordinate. And we are and a texture coordinate. And we are going to go ahead and throw a texture on going to go ahead and throw a texture on going to go ahead and throw a texture on here. I'm going to use the Gabber here. I'm going to use the Gabber here. I'm going to use the Gabber texture because I've never actually used texture because I've never actually used texture because I've never actually used it on the YouTube channel yet. and it's it on the YouTube channel yet. and it's it on the YouTube channel yet. and it's going to give you something really cool going to give you something really cool going to give you something really cool like this. So now we've completely lost like this. So now we've completely lost like this. So now we've completely lost the logo. So now I'm going to go ahead the logo. So now I'm going to go ahead the logo. So now I'm going to go ahead and get in a mix color node to create a and get in a mix color node to create a and get in a mix color node to create a bypass. So we can just say how much of bypass. So we can just say how much of bypass. So we can just say how much of this texture are we actually wanting um this texture are we actually wanting um this texture are we actually wanting um to see. So this is a really really cool to see. So this is a really really cool to see. So this is a really really cool texture. Again, one that I've not talked texture. Again, one that I've not talked texture. Again, one that I've not talked about, but you can change the about, but you can change the about, but you can change the orientation to actually fit the shape of orientation to actually fit the shape of orientation to actually fit the shape of the Nike logo. So when we morph it in, the Nike logo. So when we morph it in, the Nike logo. So when we morph it in, it it it actually makes more sense in terms of actually makes more sense in terms of actually makes more sense in terms of this transition. Uh there's a lot of this transition. Uh there's a lot of this transition. Uh there's a lot of really really cool things that you can really really cool things that you can really really cool things that you can do uh with this texture. But look at do uh with this texture. But look at do uh with this texture. But look at that. All we have to do is animate this that. All we have to do is animate this that. All we have to do is animate this in. So let's go ahead. So I'm going to in. So let's go ahead. So I'm going to in. So let's go ahead. So I'm going to go ahead and set up my camera just to go ahead and set up my camera just to go ahead and set up my camera just to have most of the logo. I really like the have most of the logo. I really like the have most of the logo. I really like the composition of cutting off part of the composition of cutting off part of the composition of cutting off part of the logo. I think it looks really, really, logo. I think it looks really, really, logo. I think it looks really, really, really cool. And then what I'm going to really cool. And then what I'm going to really cool. And then what I'm going to do now is because we have kind of a high do now is because we have kind of a high do now is because we have kind of a high emission, we can go into the emission, we can go into the emission, we can go into the compositing right here. I'm going just compositing right here. I'm going just compositing right here. I'm going just click use node and get a glare node. Set click use node and get a glare node. Set click use node and get a glare node. Set it to bloom. And then we can go back to it to bloom. And then we can go back to it to bloom. And then we can go back to layout. And I'm just going to go say layout. And I'm just going to go say layout. And I'm just going to go say always. And then we can just make it always. And then we can just make it always. And then we can just make it glow a little bit. And then you can glow a little bit. And then you can glow a little bit. And then you can change the color of your logo here. Nike change the color of your logo here. Nike change the color of your logo here. Nike does love red. So we'll do that. And does love red. So we'll do that. And does love red. So we'll do that. And then all we have to do is just then all we have to do is just then all we have to do is just animate this factor to whatever extent animate this factor to whatever extent animate this factor to whatever extent you want it to start. Maybe something you want it to start. Maybe something you want it to start. Maybe something like that looks really cool. So I'm like that looks really cool. So I'm like that looks really cool. So I'm going to go ahead. You'll just hit I on going to go ahead. You'll just hit I on going to go ahead. You'll just hit I on the factor. Go to maybe 120. Bring it the factor. Go to maybe 120. Bring it the factor. Go to maybe 120. Bring it over. And then we can over. And then we can over. And then we can enjoy enjoy enjoy this. Just like that. And that is how this. Just like that. And that is how this. Just like that. And that is how you create logos and morph them with you create logos and morph them with you create logos and morph them with textures. This is my favorite animation textures. This is my favorite animation textures. This is my favorite animation of all of them. yet it's probably one of of all of them. yet it's probably one of of all of them. yet it's probably one of the most simple ways to execute um this the most simple ways to execute um this the most simple ways to execute um this idea. So, let me show you how to do it. idea. So, let me show you how to do it. idea. So, let me show you how to do it. So, just like always, we're going to So, just like always, we're going to So, just like always, we're going to start with the SVG of our logo. What I'm start with the SVG of our logo. What I'm start with the SVG of our logo. What I'm going to do is I'm just going to pull going to do is I'm just going to pull going to do is I'm just going to pull off uh the geometry and we're just going off uh the geometry and we're just going off uh the geometry and we're just going to extrude it so we have these nice to extrude it so we have these nice to extrude it so we have these nice walls. And then I'm going to go ahead walls. And then I'm going to go ahead walls. And then I'm going to go ahead and get a plane. So, if I go to the very and get a plane. So, if I go to the very and get a plane. So, if I go to the very top and I hop into cycles, you can see top and I hop into cycles, you can see top and I hop into cycles, you can see our logo and we'll add a material and our logo and we'll add a material and our logo and we'll add a material and tell it to be emissive. So, off the bat, tell it to be emissive. So, off the bat, tell it to be emissive. So, off the bat, we have something pretty cool and very, we have something pretty cool and very, we have something pretty cool and very, very simple. We can even go ahead and very simple. We can even go ahead and very simple. We can even go ahead and add some color to it. But, if I take add some color to it. But, if I take add some color to it. But, if I take this logo and I duplicate it, we can go this logo and I duplicate it, we can go this logo and I duplicate it, we can go back into the curve settings and right back into the curve settings and right back into the curve settings and right here on offset, we can get another one here on offset, we can get another one here on offset, we can get another one and just bring it in a little bit. So, and just bring it in a little bit. So, and just bring it in a little bit. So, that's going to allow something really, that's going to allow something really, that's going to allow something really, really cool to happen. So if we go back really cool to happen. So if we go back really cool to happen. So if we go back to the top, I could take this texture. to the top, I could take this texture. to the top, I could take this texture. We can now just maybe make it black and We can now just maybe make it black and We can now just maybe make it black and now it limits. Now it's the only the now it limits. Now it's the only the now it limits. Now it's the only the inner inner inner texture that is creating emission and texture that is creating emission and texture that is creating emission and it's blocking the other one. Or we can it's blocking the other one. Or we can it's blocking the other one. Or we can do the opposite. We can just bring that do the opposite. We can just bring that do the opposite. We can just bring that in and now it's just a texture on the in and now it's just a texture on the in and now it's just a texture on the outside. But here is where we can make outside. But here is where we can make outside. But here is where we can make it look really, really awesome. And then it look really, really awesome. And then it look really, really awesome. And then if we head to the shader editor, I'm if we head to the shader editor, I'm if we head to the shader editor, I'm going to go ahead and put the same going to go ahead and put the same going to go ahead and put the same material on both of them just to make my material on both of them just to make my material on both of them just to make my life easy. And let's plug a texture into life easy. And let's plug a texture into life easy. And let's plug a texture into the emission with a color ramp. So we the emission with a color ramp. So we the emission with a color ramp. So we have a noise texture plugged into this. have a noise texture plugged into this. have a noise texture plugged into this. So now if we make it So now if we make it So now if we make it 4D, you can have a lot of fun with this. 4D, you can have a lot of fun with this. 4D, you can have a lot of fun with this. Say bring the detail down, bring the Say bring the detail down, bring the Say bring the detail down, bring the scale up, and you can do something scale up, and you can do something scale up, and you can do something really awesome. So say we're going to really awesome. So say we're going to really awesome. So say we're going to put this over to put this over to put this over to BPLine. I'm going to add another black BPLine. I'm going to add another black BPLine. I'm going to add another black just to crunch in the black portions. just to crunch in the black portions. just to crunch in the black portions. I'm going to make this red. I'm going to make this red. I'm going to make this red. I'm going to make another one a deep I'm going to make another one a deep I'm going to make another one a deep blue so that we can just have a nice red blue so that we can just have a nice red blue so that we can just have a nice red highlight. Then we'll bring the strength highlight. Then we'll bring the strength highlight. Then we'll bring the strength up pretty good. And so now we up pretty good. And so now we up pretty good. And so now we have we have have we have have we have this. But here is the really really cool this. But here is the really really cool this. But here is the really really cool part. I'm going to go ahead and click on part. I'm going to go ahead and click on part. I'm going to go ahead and click on the inner the inner the inner material, duplicate it so it's material, duplicate it so it's material, duplicate it so it's different, and maybe make the in the different, and maybe make the in the different, and maybe make the in the maybe make the texture on the inside maybe make the texture on the inside maybe make the texture on the inside darker and the texture on the outside a darker and the texture on the outside a darker and the texture on the outside a lot brighter. You can now independently lot brighter. You can now independently lot brighter. You can now independently control each texture. And you can control each texture. And you can control each texture. And you can animate the speeds and the directions of animate the speeds and the directions of animate the speeds and the directions of those at different speeds, giving them a those at different speeds, giving them a those at different speeds, giving them a really, really cool look. And because really, really cool look. And because really, really cool look. And because it's the logo, it stays to the logo and it's the logo, it stays to the logo and it's the logo, it stays to the logo and you have something really, really cool you have something really, really cool you have something really, really cool and honestly very beautiful, especially and honestly very beautiful, especially and honestly very beautiful, especially with the colors you can pick. You can with the colors you can pick. You can with the colors you can pick. You can add a glare node. It's incredibly add a glare node. It's incredibly add a glare node. It's incredibly simple. U but as long as you have access simple. U but as long as you have access simple. U but as long as you have access to using the text tool or using curves to using the text tool or using curves to using the text tool or using curves and you can bring in one of those logos. and you can bring in one of those logos. and you can bring in one of those logos. It's very simple and it's awesome. So, It's very simple and it's awesome. So, It's very simple and it's awesome. So, there's a lot of ideas that might lead there's a lot of ideas that might lead there's a lot of ideas that might lead you to wanting to fill the inside of you to wanting to fill the inside of you to wanting to fill the inside of your logo with objects. So, I'm going to your logo with objects. So, I'm going to your logo with objects. So, I'm going to show you two very similar methods on how show you two very similar methods on how show you two very similar methods on how to get objects filled. a different to get objects filled. a different to get objects filled. a different method that's going to allow you to method that's going to allow you to method that's going to allow you to animate the objects, but both have their animate the objects, but both have their animate the objects, but both have their kind of pros and cons. All right, so I kind of pros and cons. All right, so I kind of pros and cons. All right, so I have my logo. What I'm gonna do is open have my logo. What I'm gonna do is open have my logo. What I'm gonna do is open up a geometry nodes window. And we are up a geometry nodes window. And we are up a geometry nodes window. And we are going to be using geometry nodes to going to be using geometry nodes to going to be using geometry nodes to create this effect. So if we click new, create this effect. So if we click new, create this effect. So if we click new, you can actually go ahead and convert you can actually go ahead and convert you can actually go ahead and convert this into a volume like this. And you this into a volume like this. And you this into a volume like this. And you can bring that voxal amount to kind of can bring that voxal amount to kind of can bring that voxal amount to kind of smooth it and make it look really nice. smooth it and make it look really nice. smooth it and make it look really nice. And then we can do a distribute points And then we can do a distribute points And then we can do a distribute points in volume. And then you can just bring in volume. And then you can just bring in volume. And then you can just bring that density up. And now you have the that density up. And now you have the that density up. And now you have the shape of your logo. You can also just shape of your logo. You can also just shape of your logo. You can also just use the points themselves as the object use the points themselves as the object use the points themselves as the object and they will render out as just a round and they will render out as just a round and they will render out as just a round ball. In this case, this is exactly what ball. In this case, this is exactly what ball. In this case, this is exactly what I want. Go ahead and actually bring the I want. Go ahead and actually bring the I want. Go ahead and actually bring the original back with a join geometry. And original back with a join geometry. And original back with a join geometry. And then we can add materials to this so we then we can add materials to this so we then we can add materials to this so we can actually appreciate it. So I'll just can actually appreciate it. So I'll just can actually appreciate it. So I'll just add a add a add a material. Make it material. Make it material. Make it glass. And you can now see the inside of glass. And you can now see the inside of glass. And you can now see the inside of your scene. And just bring up that your scene. And just bring up that your scene. And just bring up that density a whole bunch. And now you have density a whole bunch. And now you have density a whole bunch. And now you have your logo. The problem is if I want to your logo. The problem is if I want to your logo. The problem is if I want to make these objects move around, they are make these objects move around, they are make these objects move around, they are going to be shooting. I mean, you can going to be shooting. I mean, you can going to be shooting. I mean, you can already see some of them are coming out. already see some of them are coming out. already see some of them are coming out. And that's just going to be editing your And that's just going to be editing your And that's just going to be editing your seed value to make sure they're all seed value to make sure they're all seed value to make sure they're all inside of it. But if I want to actually inside of it. But if I want to actually inside of it. But if I want to actually animate this, I can't. It's too They're animate this, I can't. It's too They're animate this, I can't. It's too They're too close to the edge already. So, let too close to the edge already. So, let too close to the edge already. So, let me show you something you can do me show you something you can do me show you something you can do instead. I'm going to kill this node instead. I'm going to kill this node instead. I'm going to kill this node tree. And what we'll do, so what I can tree. And what we'll do, so what I can tree. And what we'll do, so what I can do is I can duplicate my logo. And then do is I can duplicate my logo. And then do is I can duplicate my logo. And then I'm going to take the original one and I'm going to take the original one and I'm going to take the original one and in the curve settings right here, you in the curve settings right here, you in the curve settings right here, you can just bring that offset in just like can just bring that offset in just like can just bring that offset in just like this. And also bring that extrude in. So this. And also bring that extrude in. So this. And also bring that extrude in. So you now have a smaller, skinnier version you now have a smaller, skinnier version you now have a smaller, skinnier version of the logo. We can go back to geometry of the logo. We can go back to geometry of the logo. We can go back to geometry nodes. And if I pull that old node tree nodes. And if I pull that old node tree nodes. And if I pull that old node tree back and delete the original. So now we back and delete the original. So now we back and delete the original. So now we have a bunch of objects that we can then have a bunch of objects that we can then have a bunch of objects that we can then if we get a set position and animate if we get a set position and animate if we get a set position and animate these with a noise texture. We can now these with a noise texture. We can now these with a noise texture. We can now take these guys and you can do take these guys and you can do take these guys and you can do this with the original geometry. So now this with the original geometry. So now this with the original geometry. So now you can actually take these particles, you can actually take these particles, you can actually take these particles, bring them up a little bit and actually bring them up a little bit and actually bring them up a little bit and actually animate objects inside of your logo. So animate objects inside of your logo. So animate objects inside of your logo. So both of these methods do populate the both of these methods do populate the both of these methods do populate the inside. though it's just not going to inside. though it's just not going to inside. though it's just not going to feel full. But that is how the two feel full. But that is how the two feel full. But that is how the two methods of populating the inside of a methods of populating the inside of a methods of populating the inside of a logo. Staying on the geometry nodes logo. Staying on the geometry nodes logo. Staying on the geometry nodes topic, you can actually use masks to topic, you can actually use masks to topic, you can actually use masks to delete objects. You can use masks to delete objects. You can use masks to delete objects. You can use masks to control geometry within geometry nodes control geometry within geometry nodes control geometry within geometry nodes to have some really really cool options to have some really really cool options to have some really really cool options with making interesting things using with making interesting things using with making interesting things using masks, creating geometry in geometry masks, creating geometry in geometry masks, creating geometry in geometry nodes. It's very, very powerful. Just nodes. It's very, very powerful. Just nodes. It's very, very powerful. Just like earlier in the video, we are going like earlier in the video, we are going like earlier in the video, we are going to need a black and white version of our to need a black and white version of our to need a black and white version of our logo. I'm just going to start with a logo. I'm just going to start with a logo. I'm just going to start with a grid in geometry nodes. I'm going to grid in geometry nodes. I'm going to grid in geometry nodes. I'm going to scale it up and give it subdivisions of scale it up and give it subdivisions of scale it up and give it subdivisions of 80. The biggest obstacle to making this 80. The biggest obstacle to making this 80. The biggest obstacle to making this work is mapping the logo properly. So, work is mapping the logo properly. So, work is mapping the logo properly. So, let me show you how to do that. We're let me show you how to do that. We're let me show you how to do that. We're going to do a we're going to go ahead going to do a we're going to go ahead going to do a we're going to go ahead and convert this over to just regular and convert this over to just regular and convert this over to just regular points so we can actually see the logo. points so we can actually see the logo. points so we can actually see the logo. And then if you get a delete geometry, And then if you get a delete geometry, And then if you get a delete geometry, that's going to say, "Hey, delete that's going to say, "Hey, delete that's going to say, "Hey, delete points." We're going to go ahead and points." We're going to go ahead and points." We're going to go ahead and throw an image texture right onto this throw an image texture right onto this throw an image texture right onto this and grab our logo. So, we're going to and grab our logo. So, we're going to and grab our logo. So, we're going to use the Blender logo. And you can see use the Blender logo. And you can see use the Blender logo. And you can see some type of tiling is happening here. some type of tiling is happening here. some type of tiling is happening here. So, we're going to go here from repeat So, we're going to go here from repeat So, we're going to go here from repeat to clip. I only want one logo. And to clip. I only want one logo. And to clip. I only want one logo. And typically, we'd want a mapping node. We typically, we'd want a mapping node. We typically, we'd want a mapping node. We can't do that. We don't have a mapping can't do that. We don't have a mapping can't do that. We don't have a mapping node, geometry nodes, but a mapping node node, geometry nodes, but a mapping node node, geometry nodes, but a mapping node is just vector math. So, if we plug in a is just vector math. So, if we plug in a is just vector math. So, if we plug in a position and add, you can see, okay, now position and add, you can see, okay, now position and add, you can see, okay, now we can put this logo wherever we want. we can put this logo wherever we want. we can put this logo wherever we want. And then a scale node is just going to And then a scale node is just going to And then a scale node is just going to keep that logo exactly how we want it. keep that logo exactly how we want it. keep that logo exactly how we want it. It's not going to stretch or squash it. It's not going to stretch or squash it. It's not going to stretch or squash it. It's going to respect uh where it, you It's going to respect uh where it, you It's going to respect uh where it, you know, how it wants to to look. So now we know, how it wants to to look. So now we know, how it wants to to look. So now we have this. And then we can just go ahead have this. And then we can just go ahead have this. And then we can just go ahead and invert this. Now we have a logo made and invert this. Now we have a logo made and invert this. Now we have a logo made of points, which is awesome. Now we of points, which is awesome. Now we of points, which is awesome. Now we could do whatever we want here. We could could do whatever we want here. We could could do whatever we want here. We could go ahead and just instance a cube on go ahead and just instance a cube on go ahead and just instance a cube on every single one of these points that we every single one of these points that we every single one of these points that we have. Then you can use a noise texture have. Then you can use a noise texture have. Then you can use a noise texture to actually animate the scale which can to actually animate the scale which can to actually animate the scale which can look really really cool. And then now look really really cool. And then now look really really cool. And then now you have something really really awesome you have something really really awesome you have something really really awesome like pretty quick and you can use any like pretty quick and you can use any like pretty quick and you can use any object you want. But now we're at the object you want. But now we're at the object you want. But now we're at the shape of the logo. So you can so you shape of the logo. So you can so you shape of the logo. So you can so you have a lot of data. So if you are have a lot of data. So if you are have a lot of data. So if you are familiar with geometry nodes taking this familiar with geometry nodes taking this familiar with geometry nodes taking this mapping a logo doing something really mapping a logo doing something really mapping a logo doing something really cool on Patreon I was able to take this cool on Patreon I was able to take this cool on Patreon I was able to take this add a sur add some surrounding objects add a sur add some surrounding objects add a sur add some surrounding objects to it controlling that with the image to it controlling that with the image to it controlling that with the image texture added a procedural wood material texture added a procedural wood material texture added a procedural wood material to it. So the creative application to to it. So the creative application to to it. So the creative application to just a little bit of this data in just a little bit of this data in just a little bit of this data in geometry nodes, especially if you're geometry nodes, especially if you're geometry nodes, especially if you're familiar with geometry nodes, can really familiar with geometry nodes, can really familiar with geometry nodes, can really yield some really awesome things. yield some really awesome things. yield some really awesome things. Another really cool thing could just be Another really cool thing could just be Another really cool thing could just be getting like a curved circle and then getting like a curved circle and then getting like a curved circle and then randomizing some of these objects. You randomizing some of these objects. You randomizing some of these objects. You can do another delete geometry and just can do another delete geometry and just can do another delete geometry and just do a random value boolean and then you do a random value boolean and then you do a random value boolean and then you can just have maybe like some of these can just have maybe like some of these can just have maybe like some of these disappearing to give you more of an disappearing to give you more of an disappearing to give you more of an organic look. So now some of these organic look. So now some of these organic look. So now some of these objects are missing and you can even use objects are missing and you can even use objects are missing and you can even use a noise texture too if you want to a noise texture too if you want to a noise texture too if you want to animate this look. So there's a lot of animate this look. So there's a lot of animate this look. So there's a lot of really really effective uses of this really really effective uses of this really really effective uses of this idea in geometry nodes, but having this idea in geometry nodes, but having this idea in geometry nodes, but having this image texture really cool. Last thing image texture really cool. Last thing image texture really cool. Last thing I'm going to show you is how to get a I'm going to show you is how to get a I'm going to show you is how to get a logo very quickly to look like this logo very quickly to look like this logo very quickly to look like this little furball. We're not going to go little furball. We're not going to go little furball. We're not going to go really really in depth with this. If you really really in depth with this. If you really really in depth with this. If you want to get in depth with this exact want to get in depth with this exact want to get in depth with this exact process, Southern Shotty has an awesome process, Southern Shotty has an awesome process, Southern Shotty has an awesome video that I highly recommend if you video that I highly recommend if you video that I highly recommend if you want to really get into this. But I'm want to really get into this. But I'm want to really get into this. But I'm going to show you the bones of how to going to show you the bones of how to going to show you the bones of how to get some fur super fast. So I remshed get some fur super fast. So I remshed get some fur super fast. So I remshed and smoothed the logo. I do want it to and smoothed the logo. I do want it to and smoothed the logo. I do want it to be kind of nice and round looking like be kind of nice and round looking like be kind of nice and round looking like something like this. And then I'm just something like this. And then I'm just something like this. And then I'm just going to go convert it to a mesh. Now, going to go convert it to a mesh. Now, going to go convert it to a mesh. Now, for this you need UVs. This actually for this you need UVs. This actually for this you need UVs. This actually works quite well, but if you just hit U works quite well, but if you just hit U works quite well, but if you just hit U and do a smart UV project and click and do a smart UV project and click and do a smart UV project and click unwrap, you can actually see like not unwrap, you can actually see like not unwrap, you can actually see like not bad in in this in this context. It bad in in this in this context. It bad in in this in this context. It actually works very well. It's certainly actually works very well. It's certainly actually works very well. It's certainly not perfect, but it works really well. not perfect, but it works really well. not perfect, but it works really well. here. What we'll do is I'll just hit F3 here. What we'll do is I'll just hit F3 here. What we'll do is I'll just hit F3 and click on a quick fur. So now we have and click on a quick fur. So now we have and click on a quick fur. So now we have this. If I go here to cycles, we we have this. If I go here to cycles, we we have this. If I go here to cycles, we we have fur. So it's going to open up a bunch of fur. So it's going to open up a bunch of fur. So it's going to open up a bunch of these modifiers. Really simply, this top these modifiers. Really simply, this top these modifiers. Really simply, this top modifier is just going to control the modifier is just going to control the modifier is just going to control the way that the individual hair looks in way that the individual hair looks in way that the individual hair looks in terms of how big it is. You have your terms of how big it is. You have your terms of how big it is. You have your shape, which is going to kind of play shape, which is going to kind of play shape, which is going to kind of play with, oh, where is sort of the with, oh, where is sort of the with, oh, where is sort of the skinniness. So it inverts it like that. skinniness. So it inverts it like that. skinniness. So it inverts it like that. is I'm have a radius of is I'm have a radius of is I'm have a radius of 03. I want kind of a thicker guy. And 03. I want kind of a thicker guy. And 03. I want kind of a thicker guy. And then maybe my max brings this down a then maybe my max brings this down a then maybe my max brings this down a little bit, but honestly, we'll keep it little bit, but honestly, we'll keep it little bit, but honestly, we'll keep it here. Maybe bring my max down a little here. Maybe bring my max down a little here. Maybe bring my max down a little bit. This next modifier is going to bit. This next modifier is going to bit. This next modifier is going to control how many hairs are going to show control how many hairs are going to show control how many hairs are going to show up in your render and your viewport. So, up in your render and your viewport. So, up in your render and your viewport. So, we have density here. So, what I'm going we have density here. So, what I'm going we have density here. So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to do my viewport to do is I'm going to do my viewport to do is I'm going to do my viewport amount of like 0.005 amount of like 0.005 amount of like 0.005 000 five and then I'm going to do a 000 five and then I'm going to do a 000 five and then I'm going to do a density of I'm going to do like 80,000. density of I'm going to do like 80,000. density of I'm going to do like 80,000. So now you'll notice in the render it's So now you'll notice in the render it's So now you'll notice in the render it's full big hairy guy but this is the full big hairy guy but this is the full big hairy guy but this is the viewport. So this allows you to look at viewport. So this allows you to look at viewport. So this allows you to look at your edits in real time but already your edits in real time but already your edits in real time but already immediately this looks awesome. This immediately this looks awesome. This immediately this looks awesome. This next one plays with the overall noise next one plays with the overall noise next one plays with the overall noise pattern that creates those waves and pattern that creates those waves and pattern that creates those waves and shapes that you can see in this render. shapes that you can see in this render. shapes that you can see in this render. You can see that it's a noise texture. You can see that it's a noise texture. You can see that it's a noise texture. This next one, the frizz actually edits This next one, the frizz actually edits This next one, the frizz actually edits the kind of a noise pattern on the the kind of a noise pattern on the the kind of a noise pattern on the individual hair rather than the full individual hair rather than the full individual hair rather than the full each individual hair. So I play with So each individual hair. So I play with So each individual hair. So I play with So if I play with the shape on these hairs, if I play with the shape on these hairs, if I play with the shape on these hairs, you'll notice it kind of straightens you'll notice it kind of straightens you'll notice it kind of straightens them out. If I bring them down, it them out. If I bring them down, it them out. If I bring them down, it frizzes them a little bit more. So I'm frizzes them a little bit more. So I'm frizzes them a little bit more. So I'm going to play with the distance on the going to play with the distance on the going to play with the distance on the frizz and make it frizz and make it frizz and make it really kind of tangly, but it really kind of tangly, but it really kind of tangly, but it also makes them bigger. And so now we also makes them bigger. And so now we also makes them bigger. And so now we can head into the curve presets that can head into the curve presets that can head into the curve presets that Blender very recently added. So if we go Blender very recently added. So if we go Blender very recently added. So if we go here to the asset browser, I'm going to here to the asset browser, I'm going to here to the asset browser, I'm going to go to the very go to the very go to the very bottom and I'm going to want to get a bottom and I'm going to want to get a bottom and I'm going to want to get a trim hair curves modifier. And what trim hair curves modifier. And what trim hair curves modifier. And what that's going to do is trim the length that's going to do is trim the length that's going to do is trim the length based on all those edits. And then what based on all those edits. And then what based on all those edits. And then what I don't want is it to look like I took a I don't want is it to look like I took a I don't want is it to look like I took a razor and just raise razored the top. razor and just raise razored the top. razor and just raise razored the top. So, I'm going to get them the max length So, I'm going to get them the max length So, I'm going to get them the max length I want them here. And then the random I want them here. And then the random I want them here. And then the random offset will bring a couple of them down. offset will bring a couple of them down. offset will bring a couple of them down. So, now it's a bit of a random look. And So, now it's a bit of a random look. And So, now it's a bit of a random look. And this is what we have so far. Very this is what we have so far. Very this is what we have so far. Very quickly, it looks really good. Of quickly, it looks really good. Of quickly, it looks really good. Of course, if you want a little bit if you course, if you want a little bit if you course, if you want a little bit if you want control over the material, we do want control over the material, we do want control over the material, we do have a fur material right here. So, what have a fur material right here. So, what have a fur material right here. So, what I would do is just go ahead and add that I would do is just go ahead and add that I would do is just go ahead and add that fur material also to the base. That says fur material also to the base. That says fur material also to the base. That says curve. That's our logo. We'll click back curve. That's our logo. We'll click back curve. That's our logo. We'll click back on curves. And then we can just switch on curves. And then we can just switch on curves. And then we can just switch this guy over to the shader editor. Make this guy over to the shader editor. Make this guy over to the shader editor. Make sure you click use nodes. And you'll now sure you click use nodes. And you'll now sure you click use nodes. And you'll now have access to adding materials to this. have access to adding materials to this. have access to adding materials to this. So I'm going to make it really rough. So I'm going to make it really rough. So I'm going to make it really rough. You can plug a noise texture into this You can plug a noise texture into this You can plug a noise texture into this whole system like that. Let's see how whole system like that. Let's see how whole system like that. Let's see how this looks in a final and we'll be this looks in a final and we'll be this looks in a final and we'll be completely done. And here we have it. A completely done. And here we have it. A completely done. And here we have it. A very quick furry logo. I showed you very quick furry logo. I showed you very quick furry logo. I showed you about 10% of the controls here. There's about 10% of the controls here. There's about 10% of the controls here. There's a lot more you can do with this, but I a lot more you can do with this, but I a lot more you can do with this, but I wanted to show you the quickest way to wanted to show you the quickest way to wanted to show you the quickest way to make it just look really nice and really make it just look really nice and really make it just look really nice and really cool for ideiation reasons. And you can cool for ideiation reasons. And you can cool for ideiation reasons. And you can check out that video from Southern check out that video from Southern check out that video from Southern Shoddy uh to really take this further. Shoddy uh to really take this further. Shoddy uh to really take this further. So, there you guys go. That is six So, there you guys go. That is six So, there you guys go. That is six concepts that you can do kind of concepts that you can do kind of concepts that you can do kind of hundreds of things with just those base hundreds of things with just those base hundreds of things with just those base ideas on how to change logos. Of course, ideas on how to change logos. Of course, ideas on how to change logos. Of course, logo and Blender just means geometry in logo and Blender just means geometry in logo and Blender just means geometry in the shape of a logo. So, that's kind of the shape of a logo. So, that's kind of the shape of a logo. So, that's kind of the way to look at it. You can sculpt, the way to look at it. You can sculpt, the way to look at it. You can sculpt, you can weight paint, you can do so many you can weight paint, you can do so many you can weight paint, you can do so many things with logos to really bring brands things with logos to really bring brands things with logos to really bring brands to life and make them look awesome. And to life and make them look awesome. And to life and make them look awesome.
