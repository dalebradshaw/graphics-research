## Summary
In this blender tutorial we will be using geometry nodes to create light trails.

## Notes
In this blender tutorial we will be using geometry nodes to create light trails. We will be using curves and the shading system in combination to create this beautiful effect. This is a very powerful motion graphics technique that can be used in many different ways for your own original artwork. ￼￼ #geometrynodes #blender3d #tutorial ----------------------------- Patreon - https://patreon.com/user?u=9011118&utm_medium=clipboard_copy&utm_source=copyLink&utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator&utm_content=join_link ----------------------------------------------- 🌐 Connect with me: - Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/ducky3d/ - Twitter: https://twitter.com/Ducky3d

How's it going, guys? So, in this How's it going, guys? So, in this How's it going, guys? So, in this tutorial, we are going to be creating tutorial, we are going to be creating tutorial, we are going to be creating this animation right here. It's going to this animation right here. It's going to this animation right here. It's going to be really fun and relatively quick to be really fun and relatively quick to be really fun and relatively quick to make. First thing we're going to do is make. First thing we're going to do is make. First thing we're going to do is make a circular array of curves. Then, make a circular array of curves. Then, make a circular array of curves. Then, we're going to go ahead and displace the we're going to go ahead and displace the we're going to go ahead and displace the curves and shape them to look a little curves and shape them to look a little curves and shape them to look a little bit more like hills. Then, through a few bit more like hills. Then, through a few bit more like hills. Then, through a few steps, we're going to use a wave texture steps, we're going to use a wave texture steps, we're going to use a wave texture to create this really beautiful to create this really beautiful to create this really beautiful animation. After that, we'll be animation. After that, we'll be animation. After that, we'll be completely done. This animation is part completely done. This animation is part completely done. This animation is part of a series of tutorials here on YouTube of a series of tutorials here on YouTube of a series of tutorials here on YouTube that are inspired by topographic map art that are inspired by topographic map art that are inspired by topographic map art and animations. I'll be posting four of and animations. I'll be posting four of and animations. I'll be posting four of these tutorials backtoback here on these tutorials backtoback here on these tutorials backtoback here on YouTube. So, if you want to learn more YouTube. So, if you want to learn more YouTube.

They're all the other ones like this. They're all the other ones like this. They're all really cool and there's a lot of fun really cool and there's a lot of fun really cool and there's a lot of fun things to learn. On Patreon, I posted things to learn. On Patreon, I posted things to learn. On Patreon, I posted what I'm calling the topographic what I'm calling the topographic what I'm calling the topographic blueprint, which is an hour and 20 blueprint, which is an hour and 20 blueprint, which is an hour and 20 minutes of training of all the shading, minutes of training of all the shading, minutes of training of all the shading, geometry nodes, and animation tricks geometry nodes, and animation tricks geometry nodes, and animation tricks that are combined to make these four that are combined to make these four that are combined to make these four animations and many others. Here on animations and many others. Here on animations and many others. Here on YouTube, all those elements are combined YouTube, all those elements are combined YouTube, all those elements are combined to make really cool animations. But on to make really cool animations. But on to make really cool animations. But on Patreon, I'm showing you every Patreon, I'm showing you every Patreon, I'm showing you every individual effect and tip and trick so individual effect and tip and trick so individual effect and tip and trick so that you can combine them and make your that you can combine them and make your that you can combine them and make your own original topographic map inspired own original topographic map inspired own original topographic map inspired animations. So, if you want to check animations. So, if you want to check animations. So, if you want to check that out, that is going to be linked in that out, that is going to be linked in that out, that is going to be linked in the description and you can get a the description and you can get a the description and you can get a discount if you subscribe annually. With discount if you subscribe annually. With discount if you subscribe annually. With that being said, let's get into this that being said, let's get into this that being said, let's get into this tutorial. All right. So, first, let's go tutorial. All right. So, first, let's go tutorial. All right. So, first, let's go ahead and throw in a piece of geometry. ahead and throw in a piece of geometry. ahead and throw in a piece of geometry. I'm going to head into to geometry nodes I'm going to head into to geometry nodes I'm going to head into to geometry nodes and just get my windows the way I like and just get my windows the way I like and just get my windows the way I like uh to have, which is just one next to uh to have, which is just one next to uh to have, which is just one next to the other with the geo nodes workspace the other with the geo nodes workspace the other with the geo nodes workspace here. I'm going to go ahead and click here. I'm going to go ahead and click here. I'm going to go ahead and click new and then delete the input. And we new and then delete the input. And we new and then delete the input. And we are going to go ahead and get in a we're are going to go ahead and get in a we're are going to go ahead and get in a we're going to hit shift a search cir a curve going to hit shift a search cir a curve going to hit shift a search cir a curve circle. Plug it here. We're going to circle. Plug it here. We're going to circle. Plug it here. We're going to give it a resolution of 300. give it a resolution of 300. give it a resolution of 300. And now um when I want to make arrays And now um when I want to make arrays And now um when I want to make arrays and geometry nodes and I'm displacing and geometry nodes and I'm displacing and geometry nodes and I'm displacing that array immediately after, I like to that array immediately after, I like to that array immediately after, I like to use a simulation zone to make the array. use a simulation zone to make the array. use a simulation zone to make the array. So we're just going to go go ahead and So we're just going to go go ahead and So we're just going to go go ahead and search up simulation. And let's go ahead search up simulation. And let's go ahead search up simulation. And let's go ahead and plug and plug and plug those into there. And then we're going those into there. And then we're going those into there. And then we're going to go ahead and get in a transform to go ahead and get in a transform to go ahead and get in a transform geometry node and a join to get this uh geometry node and a join to get this uh geometry node and a join to get this uh to create the array. So get a join to create the array. So get a join to create the array. So get a join geometry and then from outside the geometry and then from outside the geometry and then from outside the simulation just go ahead and bring that simulation just go ahead and bring that simulation just go ahead and bring that back in. And we are going to scale this back in. And we are going to scale this back in. And we are going to scale this by 1.005. by 1.005. by 1.005. That is going to get you just barely That is going to get you just barely That is going to get you just barely next to it. And if you press play, it is next to it. And if you press play, it is next to it. And if you press play, it is going to start duplicating going to start duplicating going to start duplicating your circles. So just press play and your circles. So just press play and your circles. So just press play and then watch the duplication happen. And then watch the duplication happen. And then watch the duplication happen. And I'm going to get 111 cuz that is what I I'm going to get 111 cuz that is what I I'm going to get 111 cuz that is what I used in mine. Really, you can do as many used in mine. Really, you can do as many used in mine. Really, you can do as many or as few as you want. So now that we or as few as you want. So now that we or as few as you want. So now that we have, you can see we have 100. It have, you can see we have 100. It have, you can see we have 100. It creates one new instance or one new creates one new instance or one new creates one new instance or one new object per frame. So we're going to go object per frame. So we're going to go object per frame. So we're going to go ahead get a bake node and bake that out. ahead get a bake node and bake that out. ahead get a bake node and bake that out. So now we can go back to the beginning So now we can go back to the beginning So now we can go back to the beginning of our timeline and nothing's going to of our timeline and nothing's going to of our timeline and nothing's going to change. Now let's go ahead. I'm going to change. Now let's go ahead. I'm going to change. Now let's go ahead. I'm going to create a good amount of space because create a good amount of space because create a good amount of space because we're going to put some attributes right we're going to put some attributes right we're going to put some attributes right here later. But for now, let's just go here later. But for now, let's just go here later. But for now, let's just go ahead and get a ahead and get a ahead and get a set set set position node and let's create the position node and let's create the position node and let's create the displacement. So, we're going to get a displacement. So, we're going to get a displacement. So, we're going to get a combine XYZ so that we can just displace combine XYZ so that we can just displace combine XYZ so that we can just displace on the Z-axis. Let's get a noise texture on the Z-axis. Let's get a noise texture on the Z-axis. Let's get a noise texture and plug color right into Z. And it's and plug color right into Z. And it's and plug color right into Z. And it's going to do that. Let's click on going to do that. Let's click on going to do that. Let's click on normalize and let's get in a vector math normalize and let's get in a vector math normalize and let's get in a vector math node. node. node. And let's switch that to scale so that And let's switch that to scale so that And let's switch that to scale so that we can adjust the strength of this we can adjust the strength of this we can adjust the strength of this effect. I'm going to give it a scale of effect. I'm going to give it a scale of effect. I'm going to give it a scale of 2.3 2.3 2.3 to look really cool. Just like that. to look really cool. Just like that. to look really cool. Just like that. Now, what I want is there to be some Now, what I want is there to be some Now, what I want is there to be some flat portions of this animation. And flat portions of this animation. And flat portions of this animation. And normally you can just go ahead get a normally you can just go ahead get a normally you can just go ahead get a color amp and it essentially kind of color amp and it essentially kind of color amp and it essentially kind of clamps it on the bottom and you get clamps it on the bottom and you get clamps it on the bottom and you get these nice flat portions. However, uh these nice flat portions. However, uh these nice flat portions. However, uh it's a really dramatic change from flat it's a really dramatic change from flat it's a really dramatic change from flat to curve. So, I don't particularly like to curve. So, I don't particularly like to curve. So, I don't particularly like that. And if you want to get a little that. And if you want to get a little that. And if you want to get a little bit more advanced on edits like this, bit more advanced on edits like this, bit more advanced on edits like this, get a get a get a RGB curves node. And then what you can RGB curves node. And then what you can RGB curves node. And then what you can do is I'm just going to throw some do is I'm just going to throw some do is I'm just going to throw some points right here, right here. And then points right here, right here. And then points right here, right here. And then here, I'm just going to bring this up here, I'm just going to bring this up here, I'm just going to bring this up just like that. And that is going to just like that. And that is going to just like that. And that is going to make that uh a little bit flat, but make that uh a little bit flat, but make that uh a little bit flat, but still have a little bit of nuance. And still have a little bit of nuance. And still have a little bit of nuance. And then we can just switch this over to then we can just switch this over to then we can just switch this over to we can click on here and switch this we can click on here and switch this we can click on here and switch this over to more of a a harsh straight line. over to more of a a harsh straight line. over to more of a a harsh straight line. You can even do that on this one. And You can even do that on this one. And You can even do that on this one. And you get these flat portions but still you get these flat portions but still you get these flat portions but still have a little bit of wave to them. have a little bit of wave to them. have a little bit of wave to them. And you can just flatten out all of And you can just flatten out all of And you can just flatten out all of these until you get some really nice these until you get some really nice these until you get some really nice looking flat portions of your scene. And looking flat portions of your scene. And looking flat portions of your scene. And then you can take the scale and bring up then you can take the scale and bring up then you can take the scale and bring up the other portions. And that is going to the other portions. And that is going to the other portions. And that is going to give you that topographic map inspired give you that topographic map inspired give you that topographic map inspired look where you have these hills, you look where you have these hills, you look where you have these hills, you have these flat portions, but still with have these flat portions, but still with have these flat portions, but still with a little bit of wave to them, which is a little bit of wave to them, which is a little bit of wave to them, which is really important for the style. And then really important for the style. And then really important for the style. And then I can go ahead maybe bring my scale out I can go ahead maybe bring my scale out I can go ahead maybe bring my scale out a little bit more. I still want more a little bit more. I still want more a little bit more. I still want more flat. flat. flat. This is pretty cool. So we can bring This is pretty cool. So we can bring This is pretty cool. So we can bring that scale up some. So now we're here. that scale up some. So now we're here. that scale up some. So now we're here. We can go ahead and start adding We can go ahead and start adding We can go ahead and start adding materials. So, I'm going to go ahead get materials. So, I'm going to go ahead get materials. So, I'm going to go ahead get a set material node right over here. a set material node right over here. a set material node right over here. We're going to click new and I'm just We're going to click new and I'm just We're going to click new and I'm just going to call this going to call this going to call this light. You can call it whatever you light. You can call it whatever you light. You can call it whatever you want. And then grab it here. So, right want. And then grab it here. So, right want. And then grab it here. So, right before the material, we're going to go before the material, we're going to go before the material, we're going to go ahead and get a ahead and get a ahead and get a curve to mesh node. And we need to get a curve to mesh node. And we need to get a curve to mesh node. And we need to get a circle. We're going to get a curve circle. We're going to get a curve circle. We're going to get a curve circle node to define um the width of circle node to define um the width of circle node to define um the width of the tubes. So, we're going to plug that the tubes. So, we're going to plug that the tubes. So, we're going to plug that there. I'm going to do a resolution of there. I'm going to do a resolution of there. I'm going to do a resolution of three and a radius of 0.001 three and a radius of 0.001 three and a radius of 0.001 for now. And we will make that thinner for now. And we will make that thinner for now. And we will make that thinner later, but I want it big enough so we later, but I want it big enough so we later, but I want it big enough so we can see the materials as we're editing can see the materials as we're editing can see the materials as we're editing them. So now we have geometry. So if I them. So now we have geometry. So if I them. So now we have geometry. So if I go over here to the shader and I click go over here to the shader and I click go over here to the shader and I click on the light, I'm going to switch this on the light, I'm going to switch this on the light, I'm going to switch this over to an emission node and then I'm over to an emission node and then I'm over to an emission node and then I'm going to switch over to the EV engine going to switch over to the EV engine going to switch over to the EV engine and let's look at it. So we have this and let's look at it. So we have this and let's look at it. So we have this going on here. What I'll do is I'm going going on here. What I'll do is I'm going going on here. What I'll do is I'm going to make this a little smaller so we can to make this a little smaller so we can to make this a little smaller so we can just look at it here. And then I'm going just look at it here. And then I'm going just look at it here. And then I'm going to bring up a new window. So I'm going to bring up a new window. So I'm going to bring up a new window. So I'm going to keep geometry nodes up here and I'm to keep geometry nodes up here and I'm to keep geometry nodes up here and I'm going to put the shading here. And let's going to put the shading here. And let's going to put the shading here. And let's go ahead and plug a wave texture and a go ahead and plug a wave texture and a go ahead and plug a wave texture and a color ramp into the color here on the color ramp into the color here on the color ramp into the color here on the emission. So do a wave texture. And we emission. So do a wave texture. And we emission. So do a wave texture. And we won't need a mapping because we're going won't need a mapping because we're going won't need a mapping because we're going to do an attribute instead. So just plug to do an attribute instead. So just plug to do an attribute instead. So just plug color right into color ramp. And notice color right into color ramp. And notice color right into color ramp. And notice our first problem. this right here. our first problem. this right here. our first problem. this right here. Notice how the wave uh it's it's going Notice how the wave uh it's it's going Notice how the wave uh it's it's going across and even if I switch this over to across and even if I switch this over to across and even if I switch this over to uh bands, it's still not going to uh bands, it's still not going to uh bands, it's still not going to respect the direction of the curves respect the direction of the curves respect the direction of the curves themselves. So, the way you can fix that themselves. So, the way you can fix that themselves. So, the way you can fix that is right before the set position is is right before the set position is is right before the set position is right before the set position, we're right before the set position, we're right before the set position, we're going to add two attributes. So, we're going to add two attributes. So, we're going to add two attributes. So, we're going to get a store named attribute. going to get a store named attribute. going to get a store named attribute. We're going to get two of them. So, the We're going to get two of them. So, the We're going to get two of them. So, the first one is going to be a first one is going to be a first one is going to be a spline parameter node. And what is he is spline parameter node. And what is he is spline parameter node. And what is he is going to be able to do is to tell the going to be able to do is to tell the going to be able to do is to tell the shading which direction the curves are shading which direction the curves are shading which direction the curves are going essentially at least at least from going essentially at least at least from going essentially at least at least from a visual standpoint. So we'll plug a visual standpoint. So we'll plug a visual standpoint. So we'll plug factor into value and we'll just name factor into value and we'll just name factor into value and we'll just name them S for um spline. And then we're I them S for um spline. And then we're I them S for um spline. And then we're I want to add some randomness to the um want to add some randomness to the um want to add some randomness to the um phase offset. So we're going to get a phase offset. So we're going to get a phase offset. So we're going to get a random value node. I want to add a random value node. I want to add a random value node. I want to add a random value per curve. So we're going random value per curve. So we're going random value per curve. So we're going to go from points to splines and then to go from points to splines and then to go from points to splines and then plug that into the value. I'm just going plug that into the value. I'm just going plug that into the value. I'm just going to call this R for random. So that's all to call this R for random. So that's all to call this R for random. So that's all we're going to need to play with here. we're going to need to play with here. we're going to need to play with here. So I can just go ahead and delete this So I can just go ahead and delete this So I can just go ahead and delete this and we can get two attribute nodes. One and we can get two attribute nodes. One and we can get two attribute nodes. One with the name R, one with the name S. So with the name R, one with the name S. So with the name R, one with the name S. So the one with the name S is the is the the one with the name S is the is the the one with the name S is the is the spline. So we'll plug factor into vector spline. So we'll plug factor into vector spline. So we'll plug factor into vector and immediately it is going to respect and immediately it is going to respect and immediately it is going to respect the direction of the curves, which is the direction of the curves, which is the direction of the curves, which is really really nice. And then just to really really nice. And then just to really really nice. And then just to make it look cooler, I'm going to go make it look cooler, I'm going to go make it look cooler, I'm going to go from sign to saw. And it is going to from sign to saw. And it is going to from sign to saw. And it is going to give the back end of it this really give the back end of it this really give the back end of it this really faded uh faded edge and the front this faded uh faded edge and the front this faded uh faded edge and the front this hard edge. So that when I bring in my hard edge. So that when I bring in my hard edge. So that when I bring in my color ramp, uh you can have some fun. color ramp, uh you can have some fun. color ramp, uh you can have some fun. And then I'm going to just go bring my And then I'm going to just go bring my And then I'm going to just go bring my world brightness down to black. So this world brightness down to black. So this world brightness down to black. So this is a little bit more of an obvious edit. is a little bit more of an obvious edit. is a little bit more of an obvious edit. You can see that's how it looks now. It You can see that's how it looks now. It You can see that's how it looks now. It looks pretty cool. Now what I want to do looks pretty cool. Now what I want to do looks pretty cool. Now what I want to do is you notice how all of the waves are is you notice how all of the waves are is you notice how all of the waves are in line with each other. I want to in line with each other. I want to in line with each other. I want to randomize the position or how you know randomize the position or how you know randomize the position or how you know where this is rotating per curve. And so where this is rotating per curve. And so where this is rotating per curve. And so we created a random value per curve we created a random value per curve we created a random value per curve attribute right here. So if I plug attribute right here. So if I plug attribute right here. So if I plug factor into phase offset, see how it's factor into phase offset, see how it's factor into phase offset, see how it's doing that? It's moving that. It's doing that? It's moving that. It's doing that? It's moving that. It's giving it a unique value for each curve. giving it a unique value for each curve. giving it a unique value for each curve. But it's not dramatic enough. I mean, But it's not dramatic enough. I mean, But it's not dramatic enough. I mean, that might be cool. That's definitely a that might be cool. That's definitely a that might be cool. That's definitely a cool look. I want it to be a little bit cool look. I want it to be a little bit cool look. I want it to be a little bit more dramatic. So, I'm going to go ahead more dramatic. So, I'm going to go ahead more dramatic. So, I'm going to go ahead and get a math node and switch it to and get a math node and switch it to and get a math node and switch it to multiply add. I want to do a multiply so multiply add. I want to do a multiply so multiply add. I want to do a multiply so I can multiply this effect to make it I can multiply this effect to make it I can multiply this effect to make it look more like that and then add so we look more like that and then add so we look more like that and then add so we can still animate all of them moving um can still animate all of them moving um can still animate all of them moving um in a circle. So, one thing you can do to in a circle. So, one thing you can do to in a circle. So, one thing you can do to edit this uh this look a little bit is edit this uh this look a little bit is edit this uh this look a little bit is see how you can do that bring it all the see how you can do that bring it all the see how you can do that bring it all the way down to this little point and then way down to this little point and then way down to this little point and then you can use the add and animate these you can use the add and animate these you can use the add and animate these guys around. What you can do is go ahead guys around. What you can do is go ahead guys around. What you can do is go ahead and make this white as well. And then and make this white as well. And then and make this white as well. And then get a new node and make him black. And get a new node and make him black. And get a new node and make him black. And so now what we can do is bring him in so now what we can do is bring him in so now what we can do is bring him in like this. Now what we can do is make like this. Now what we can do is make like this. Now what we can do is make him a darker color and then bring it in him a darker color and then bring it in him a darker color and then bring it in and make it much darker. Something like and make it much darker. Something like and make it much darker. Something like this. So that the tips of each one of this. So that the tips of each one of this. So that the tips of each one of these lines is brighter. And then it these lines is brighter. And then it these lines is brighter. And then it goes from black from gray and then into goes from black from gray and then into goes from black from gray and then into black like that. So it looks really black like that. So it looks really black like that. So it looks really really cool. So you can do something really cool. So you can do something really cool. So you can do something like this and get this really cool like this and get this really cool like this and get this really cool effect. And then you can bring up your effect. And then you can bring up your effect. And then you can bring up your strength strength strength and then bring that down a little bit and then bring that down a little bit and then bring that down a little bit more so that we can have a more obvious more so that we can have a more obvious more so that we can have a more obvious effect. And then I'm going to go here to effect. And then I'm going to go here to effect. And then I'm going to go here to the compositing window up here. Click the compositing window up here. Click the compositing window up here. Click use nodes. Get a glare node and switch use nodes. Get a glare node and switch use nodes. Get a glare node and switch it over to a fog glow. And then we can it over to a fog glow. And then we can it over to a fog glow. And then we can go back to the geometry notes window go back to the geometry notes window go back to the geometry notes window right up here. We can switch it to right up here. We can switch it to right up here. We can switch it to always. And now we can see, okay, our always. And now we can see, okay, our always. And now we can see, okay, our glow is working. And then when we uh use glow is working. And then when we uh use glow is working. And then when we uh use the addend, we can see, okay, we can the addend, we can see, okay, we can the addend, we can see, okay, we can move these guys around. Now, if you want move these guys around. Now, if you want move these guys around. Now, if you want to change the color, you can get a mix to change the color, you can get a mix to change the color, you can get a mix color node. Put this on the factor. color node. Put this on the factor. color node. Put this on the factor. Bring this. Bring the top one down to Bring this. Bring the top one down to Bring this. Bring the top one down to black and the bottom one. Choose any black and the bottom one. Choose any black and the bottom one. Choose any color you want. So, I'm going to go with color you want. So, I'm going to go with color you want. So, I'm going to go with something something something something cool like this. Cool. So, now something cool like this. Cool. So, now something cool like this. Cool. So, now we have this. Now, before we animate and we have this. Now, before we animate and we have this. Now, before we animate and finish this off, one thing I want to finish this off, one thing I want to finish this off, one thing I want to notice is all of these are animating at notice is all of these are animating at notice is all of these are animating at the same speed at the same time using the same speed at the same time using the same speed at the same time using this addend uh slider here. But what I this addend uh slider here. But what I this addend uh slider here. But what I want is I want some of these uh curves I want is I want some of these uh curves I want is I want some of these uh curves I want some of them to be faster and some want some of them to be faster and some want some of them to be faster and some of them to be slower than others. And I of them to be slower than others. And I of them to be slower than others. And I still want to animate this in a loop, still want to animate this in a loop, still want to animate this in a loop, but I don't like that they're all going but I don't like that they're all going but I don't like that they're all going the same. To me, it doesn't make it look the same. To me, it doesn't make it look the same. To me, it doesn't make it look alive enough, similar to the way it alive enough, similar to the way it alive enough, similar to the way it looks alive in my animation. So, here's looks alive in my animation. So, here's looks alive in my animation. So, here's what we can do. I can get two materials. what we can do. I can get two materials. what we can do. I can get two materials. One where the animation is going a One where the animation is going a One where the animation is going a certain speed, and the other material certain speed, and the other material certain speed, and the other material where it's going faster than the other where it's going faster than the other where it's going faster than the other one. And I need to be able to assign one. And I need to be able to assign one. And I need to be able to assign that to random ones. So, here's what we that to random ones. So, here's what we that to random ones. So, here's what we can do. I can go back to the geometry can do. I can go back to the geometry can do. I can go back to the geometry nodes editor nodes editor nodes editor right here. And then right after the set right here. And then right after the set right here. And then right after the set position right here, we're going to go position right here, we're going to go position right here, we're going to go ahead and separate all of the curves so ahead and separate all of the curves so ahead and separate all of the curves so I can assign two different materials. I can assign two different materials. I can assign two different materials. One here and another one. So let's go One here and another one. So let's go One here and another one. So let's go ahead and get a separate geometry node. ahead and get a separate geometry node. ahead and get a separate geometry node. And we're going to say separate splines. And we're going to say separate splines. And we're going to say separate splines. I'm going to get a I'm going to get a I'm going to get a random value node and switch it to random value node and switch it to random value node and switch it to boolean. That's going to make a slider. boolean. That's going to make a slider. boolean. That's going to make a slider. So what's going to happen is if I plug So what's going to happen is if I plug So what's going to happen is if I plug this into the selection, you'll notice this into the selection, you'll notice this into the selection, you'll notice some of these start to delete. We're some of these start to delete. We're some of these start to delete. We're deleting them. So I'm going to do 0.5. deleting them. So I'm going to do 0.5. deleting them. So I'm going to do 0.5. So that means exactly we're deleting So that means exactly we're deleting So that means exactly we're deleting half of them uh randomly. What this half of them uh randomly. What this half of them uh randomly. What this means is now we have access to the ones means is now we have access to the ones means is now we have access to the ones that we deleted through this inverted that we deleted through this inverted that we deleted through this inverted output. So what I can do is I can take output. So what I can do is I can take output. So what I can do is I can take these nodes here, hit control shift D or these nodes here, hit control shift D or these nodes here, hit control shift D or just um duplicate them and connect the just um duplicate them and connect the just um duplicate them and connect the inverted to the curve up here. And then we're going to get a join And then we're going to get a join And then we're going to get a join geometry. geometry. geometry. And then watch, we're going to bring And then watch, we're going to bring And then watch, we're going to bring them right back. So now them right back. So now them right back. So now the ones that we separated are are um the ones that we separated are are um the ones that we separated are are um you seen here, here, and here. And you you seen here, here, and here. And you you seen here, here, and here. And you can notice, say I can bring up the can notice, say I can bring up the can notice, say I can bring up the radius of some of them. See that? So now radius of some of them. See that? So now radius of some of them. See that? So now the radius of some of them I can change the radius of some of them I can change the radius of some of them I can change and other ones I don't. So they're and other ones I don't. So they're and other ones I don't. So they're they're separated, which also means we they're separated, which also means we they're separated, which also means we can make a separate material for each can make a separate material for each can make a separate material for each one. So, right over here where it says one. So, right over here where it says one. So, right over here where it says light, I'm going to hit the plus icon. light, I'm going to hit the plus icon. light, I'm going to hit the plus icon. Hit this drop down. Click light. And Hit this drop down. Click light. And Hit this drop down. Click light. And then I'm here. This number four, I'm then I'm here. This number four, I'm then I'm here. This number four, I'm just going to click that. It's going to just going to click that. It's going to just going to click that. It's going to make a duplicate of the material we make a duplicate of the material we make a duplicate of the material we made. And I'm just going to call this made. And I'm just going to call this made. And I'm just going to call this light light light two. And grab light two here. So now two. And grab light two here. So now two. And grab light two here. So now it's a literal duplicate of the material it's a literal duplicate of the material it's a literal duplicate of the material that we just created. So when we go back that we just created. So when we go back that we just created. So when we go back to the shader editor, you can see slot one. the shader editor, you can see slot one. the shader editor, you can see slot one. So light two. Watch what happens when we So light two. Watch what happens when we So light two. Watch what happens when we play with the addendent. Some of them play with the addendent. Some of them play with the addendent. Some of them aren't moving. aren't moving. aren't moving. So, that's pretty cool. So, we can So, that's pretty cool. So, we can So, that's pretty cool. So, we can animate them at different speeds when animate them at different speeds when animate them at different speeds when we're ready to animate. What I want to we're ready to animate. What I want to we're ready to animate. What I want to do is on some of these just make them do is on some of these just make them do is on some of these just make them brighter than others just to give it a brighter than others just to give it a brighter than others just to give it a little bit more of that randomness little bit more of that randomness little bit more of that randomness uh look. I mean, you can even change the uh look. I mean, you can even change the uh look. I mean, you can even change the color of some of them, too, if you want color of some of them, too, if you want color of some of them, too, if you want to have some fun and uh make it look to have some fun and uh make it look to have some fun and uh make it look awesome. You could do anything you want. awesome. You could do anything you want. awesome. You could do anything you want. Have a lot of fun. And uh I'm just going Have a lot of fun. And uh I'm just going Have a lot of fun. And uh I'm just going to make some of them darker. And then to make some of them darker. And then to make some of them darker. And then I'm going to switch over to slot one, I'm going to switch over to slot one, I'm going to switch over to slot one, the light, and make some of them the light, and make some of them the light, and make some of them brighter. brighter. brighter. so we can add more randomness to how so we can add more randomness to how so we can add more randomness to how this looks. So, let's just go ahead and this looks. So, let's just go ahead and this looks. So, let's just go ahead and animate them. So, I'm going to give animate them. So, I'm going to give animate them. So, I'm going to give myself 400 frames. I'm going to go back myself 400 frames. I'm going to go back myself 400 frames. I'm going to go back to frame zero and we're going to animate to frame zero and we're going to animate to frame zero and we're going to animate this in a loop. So, I'm going to go back this in a loop. So, I'm going to go back this in a loop. So, I'm going to go back here to the addend and go to zero. here to the addend and go to zero. here to the addend and go to zero. Because we want this to be a loop, we're Because we want this to be a loop, we're Because we want this to be a loop, we're going to use pi. So, I'm going to hit I going to use pi. So, I'm going to hit I going to use pi. So, I'm going to hit I on the addend, go to the end, and I'm on the addend, go to the end, and I'm on the addend, go to the end, and I'm going to type in -10* going to type in -10* going to type in -10* or asterisk pi. We're doing negative 10 or asterisk pi. We're doing negative 10 or asterisk pi. We're doing negative 10 because um if you do a positive 10, because um if you do a positive 10, because um if you do a positive 10, it'll look like it's going backwards. So it'll look like it's going backwards. So it'll look like it's going backwards. So that's the only reason why we're doing that's the only reason why we're doing that's the only reason why we're doing that. So now we have one animating at a that. So now we have one animating at a that. So now we have one animating at a nice like slow pace. We're going to go nice like slow pace. We're going to go nice like slow pace. We're going to go to slot two, which is light two. I'm to slot two, which is light two. I'm to slot two, which is light two. I'm going to go back to frame zero on the going to go back to frame zero on the going to go back to frame zero on the addend. Make sure it's at zero. I'm addend. Make sure it's at zero. I'm addend. Make sure it's at zero. I'm going hit I. I'm going to do going hit I. I'm going to do going hit I. I'm going to do I'm going to do -4 I'm going to do -4 I'm going to do -4 asterisk pi. asterisk pi. asterisk pi. And now some of them are traveling And now some of them are traveling And now some of them are traveling faster than others, which is going to faster than others, which is going to faster than others, which is going to give it this more alive uh look. So now give it this more alive uh look. So now give it this more alive uh look. So now we have this. We're done with the we have this. We're done with the we have this. We're done with the animation. Let's just go ahead and animation. Let's just go ahead and animation. Let's just go ahead and create a grid floor for the bottom. create a grid floor for the bottom. create a grid floor for the bottom. So I'm going to go and just get my So I'm going to go and just get my So I'm going to go and just get my camera. So I'm hit shift A camera. And camera. So I'm hit shift A camera. And camera. So I'm hit shift A camera. And then I'm going to hit G and middle then I'm going to hit G and middle then I'm going to hit G and middle click. I'm going to go up click. I'm going to go up click. I'm going to go up and then then I'm going to hit RX. and then then I'm going to hit RX. and then then I'm going to hit RX. Looks like I need to go up a little bit Looks like I need to go up a little bit Looks like I need to go up a little bit more. RX. more. RX. more. RX. And then I'll just go ahead and zoom in And then I'll just go ahead and zoom in And then I'll just go ahead and zoom in so that we can have a nice camera angle so that we can have a nice camera angle so that we can have a nice camera angle on this. Now, I want the floor to have a on this. Now, I want the floor to have a on this. Now, I want the floor to have a nice grid cuz I just don't like like a nice grid cuz I just don't like like a nice grid cuz I just don't like like a plain black background. I think it looks plain black background. I think it looks plain black background. I think it looks kind of lame depending. It's not always kind of lame depending. It's not always kind of lame depending. It's not always lame. So, I'm going to go ahead and get lame. So, I'm going to go ahead and get lame. So, I'm going to go ahead and get a mesh plane. And I'm going to scale it a mesh plane. And I'm going to scale it a mesh plane. And I'm going to scale it up up up so it fits the screen. And then we're so it fits the screen. And then we're so it fits the screen. And then we're going to go back to the geometry nodes going to go back to the geometry nodes going to go back to the geometry nodes editor because we have the shader editor editor because we have the shader editor editor because we have the shader editor opening there. And I'm going to get a opening there. And I'm going to get a opening there. And I'm going to get a new material. Hit period to bring it new material. Hit period to bring it new material. Hit period to bring it here. Get an emission of like three. here. Get an emission of like three. here. Get an emission of like three. We're going to get a color ramp. We're going to get a color ramp. We're going to get a color ramp. And we're going to get in a voronoid And we're going to get in a voronoid And we're going to get in a voronoid texture. And then we're going to plug texture. And then we're going to plug texture. And then we're going to plug distance into the color ramp. Bring the distance into the color ramp. Bring the distance into the color ramp. Bring the random to zero. And then I'm going to random to zero. And then I'm going to random to zero. And then I'm going to bring in my color ramp like that. So bring in my color ramp like that. So bring in my color ramp like that. So let's bring up the scale. And then I'm going to go to chvby chev And then I'm going to go to chvby chev And then I'm going to go to chvby chev on the pattern. on the pattern. on the pattern. And then just going to play with the color ramp. just going to play with the color ramp. just going to play with the color ramp. So bring it in like that. Bring the So bring it in like that. Bring the So bring it in like that. Bring the white far to the left. And then we'll white far to the left. And then we'll white far to the left. And then we'll just bring it in like this. And then just bring it in like this. And then just bring it in like this. And then make the white portion blue like the make the white portion blue like the make the white portion blue like the floor. Bring it up a little bit. We can floor. Bring it up a little bit. We can floor. Bring it up a little bit. We can even make this a little bit even make this a little bit even make this a little bit the line a little bit smaller. the line a little bit smaller. the line a little bit smaller. So now So now So now when I render this, we have this nice when I render this, we have this nice when I render this, we have this nice grid floor for the bottom. So we are grid floor for the bottom. So we are grid floor for the bottom. So we are completely done and we are going to be completely done and we are going to be completely done and we are going to be rendering this in Eevee. If you don't rendering this in Eevee. If you don't rendering this in Eevee. If you don't want to use Eevee and actually want to want to use Eevee and actually want to want to use Eevee and actually want to use cycles, you can have a little bit use cycles, you can have a little bit use cycles, you can have a little bit more fun and actually get a little bit more fun and actually get a little bit more fun and actually get a little bit of reflection on the ground. So you can of reflection on the ground. So you can of reflection on the ground. So you can make the bottom metallic, no reflection, make the bottom metallic, no reflection, make the bottom metallic, no reflection, and you can have a little bit of and you can have a little bit of and you can have a little bit of reflection on the ground if you want. reflection on the ground if you want. reflection on the ground if you want. Uh, I'm going to make it easy for my Uh, I'm going to make it easy for my Uh, I'm going to make it easy for my none uh my non cycles users and just none uh my non cycles users and just none uh my non cycles users and just keep it in Eevee. And then when you're keep it in Eevee. And then when you're keep it in Eevee. And then when you're done, you can just go ahead pick your done, you can just go ahead pick your done, you can just go ahead pick your resolution. I'm going to keep it at 1920 resolution. I'm going to keep it at 1920 resolution. I'm going to keep it at 1920 x 1080. I highly recommend PNG x 1080. I highly recommend PNG x 1080. I highly recommend PNG sequences, but you don't have to. If you sequences, but you don't have to. If you sequences, but you don't have to. If you want Blender to just spit out uh want Blender to just spit out uh want Blender to just spit out uh straight MP4, you can go from PNG to straight MP4, you can go from PNG to straight MP4, you can go from PNG to FFmpeg video encoding to MP4 or FFmpeg video encoding to MP4 or FFmpeg video encoding to MP4 or QuickTime if you're on Mac. Medium QuickTime if you're on Mac. Medium QuickTime if you're on Mac. Medium quality to perceptually lossless. quality to perceptually lossless. quality to perceptually lossless. Render, render animation. And when Render, render animation. And when Render, render animation. And when you're done, you'll have something you're done, you'll have something you're done, you'll have something really cool like mine. So there you go. really cool like mine.
