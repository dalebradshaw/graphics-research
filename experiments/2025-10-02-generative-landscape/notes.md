# Notes & Feedback

## Session log
- TODO 2025-10-02: baseline node graph, verify looped animation matches tutorial.
- TODO 2025-10-02: experiment with higher voxel resolution and assess render cost.

## Observations
- Pending.

## Follow-ups
- [ ] Capture missing transcript if manual captions become available (`needs-transcript` tag not set for `yt-7dm776rZz-s`, but cross-reference related tutorials).
- [ ] Consider exporting a .blend with node group variations for sharing.
