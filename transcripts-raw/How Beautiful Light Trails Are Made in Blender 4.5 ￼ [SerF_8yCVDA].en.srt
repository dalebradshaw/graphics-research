00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,590

How's it going, guys? So, in this

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:01,600
How's it going, guys? So, in this
 

3
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,270
How's it going, guys? So, in this
tutorial, we are going to be creating

4
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:03,280
tutorial, we are going to be creating
 

5
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,670
tutorial, we are going to be creating
this animation right here. It's going to

6
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:05,680
this animation right here. It's going to
 

7
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,670
this animation right here. It's going to
be really fun and relatively quick to

8
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:07,680
be really fun and relatively quick to
 

9
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,950
be really fun and relatively quick to
make. First thing we're going to do is

10
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:08,960
make. First thing we're going to do is
 

11
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,990
make. First thing we're going to do is
make a circular array of curves. Then,

12
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:12,000
make a circular array of curves. Then,
 

13
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,749
make a circular array of curves. Then,
we're going to go ahead and displace the

14
00:00:13,749 --> 00:00:13,759
we're going to go ahead and displace the
 

15
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,430
we're going to go ahead and displace the
curves and shape them to look a little

16
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:15,440
curves and shape them to look a little
 

17
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,189
curves and shape them to look a little
bit more like hills. Then, through a few

18
00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:17,199
bit more like hills. Then, through a few
 

19
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,950
bit more like hills. Then, through a few
steps, we're going to use a wave texture

20
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:18,960
steps, we're going to use a wave texture
 

21
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,550
steps, we're going to use a wave texture
to create this really beautiful

22
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:20,560
to create this really beautiful
 

23
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,310
to create this really beautiful
animation. After that, we'll be

24
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:22,320
animation. After that, we'll be
 

25
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,310
animation. After that, we'll be
completely done. This animation is part

26
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:24,320
completely done. This animation is part
 

27
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,390
completely done. This animation is part
of a series of tutorials here on YouTube

28
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:26,400

that being said, let's get into this

78
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:12,560
that being said, let's get into this
 

79
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,310
that being said, let's get into this
tutorial. All right. So, first, let's go

80
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:14,320
tutorial. All right. So, first, let's go
 

81
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,789
tutorial. All right. So, first, let's go
ahead and throw in a piece of geometry.

82
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:16,799
ahead and throw in a piece of geometry.
 

83
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,030
ahead and throw in a piece of geometry.
I'm going to head into to geometry nodes

84
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:19,040
I'm going to head into to geometry nodes
 

85
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,510
I'm going to head into to geometry nodes
and just get my windows the way I like

86
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:21,520
and just get my windows the way I like
 

87
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,429
and just get my windows the way I like
uh to have, which is just one next to

88
00:01:23,429 --> 00:01:23,439
uh to have, which is just one next to
 

89
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,350
uh to have, which is just one next to
the other with the geo nodes workspace

90
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:25,360
the other with the geo nodes workspace
 

91
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,429
the other with the geo nodes workspace
here. I'm going to go ahead and click

92
00:01:27,429 --> 00:01:27,439
here. I'm going to go ahead and click
 

93
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,630
here. I'm going to go ahead and click
new and then delete the input. And we

94
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:30,640
new and then delete the input. And we
 

95
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,789
new and then delete the input. And we
are going to go ahead and get in a we're

96
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:32,799
are going to go ahead and get in a we're
 

97
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,230
are going to go ahead and get in a we're
going to hit shift a search cir a curve

98
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:36,240
going to hit shift a search cir a curve
 

99
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,230
going to hit shift a search cir a curve
circle. Plug it here. We're going to

100
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:38,240
circle. Plug it here. We're going to
 

101
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,950
circle. Plug it here. We're going to
give it a resolution of 300.

102
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:40,960
give it a resolution of 300.
 

103
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,990
give it a resolution of 300.
And now um when I want to make arrays

104
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:44,000
And now um when I want to make arrays
 

105
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,550
And now um when I want to make arrays
and geometry nodes and I'm displacing

106
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:46,560
and geometry nodes and I'm displacing
 

107
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,190
and geometry nodes and I'm displacing
that array immediately after, I like to

108
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:49,200
that array immediately after, I like to
 

109
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,270
that array immediately after, I like to
use a simulation zone to make the array.

110
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:51,280
use a simulation zone to make the array.
 

111
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,870
use a simulation zone to make the array.
So we're just going to go go ahead and

112
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:52,880
So we're just going to go go ahead and
 

113
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,190
So we're just going to go go ahead and
search up simulation. And let's go ahead

114
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:55,200
search up simulation. And let's go ahead
 

115
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,109
search up simulation. And let's go ahead
and plug

116
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:57,119
and plug
 

117
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,429
and plug
those into there. And then we're going

118
00:01:59,429 --> 00:01:59,439
those into there. And then we're going
 

119
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,149
those into there. And then we're going
to go ahead and get in a transform

120
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:02,159
to go ahead and get in a transform
 

121
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,749
to go ahead and get in a transform
geometry node and a join to get this uh

122
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:05,759
geometry node and a join to get this uh
 

123
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,270
geometry node and a join to get this uh
to create the array. So get a join

124
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:07,280
to create the array. So get a join
 

125
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,949
to create the array. So get a join
geometry and then from outside the

126
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:08,959
geometry and then from outside the
 

127
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,389
geometry and then from outside the
simulation just go ahead and bring that

128
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:10,399
simulation just go ahead and bring that
 

129
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,110
simulation just go ahead and bring that
back in. And we are going to scale this

130
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,120
back in. And we are going to scale this
 

131
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,070
back in. And we are going to scale this
by 1.005.

132
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:16,080
by 1.005.
 

133
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,470
by 1.005.
That is going to get you just barely

134
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:18,480
That is going to get you just barely
 

135
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,550
That is going to get you just barely
next to it. And if you press play, it is

136
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:20,560
next to it. And if you press play, it is
 

137
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,869
next to it. And if you press play, it is
going to start duplicating

138
00:02:22,869 --> 00:02:22,879
going to start duplicating
 

139
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,630
going to start duplicating
your circles. So just press play and

140
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:26,640
your circles. So just press play and
 

141
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,229
your circles. So just press play and
then watch the duplication happen. And

142
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:28,239
then watch the duplication happen. And
 

143
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,110
then watch the duplication happen. And
I'm going to get 111 cuz that is what I

144
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,120
I'm going to get 111 cuz that is what I
 

145
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,070
I'm going to get 111 cuz that is what I
used in mine. Really, you can do as many

146
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,080
used in mine. Really, you can do as many
 

147
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,869
used in mine. Really, you can do as many
or as few as you want. So now that we

148
00:02:36,869 --> 00:02:36,879
or as few as you want. So now that we
 

149
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,030
or as few as you want. So now that we
have, you can see we have 100. It

150
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,040
have, you can see we have 100. It
 

151
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,509
have, you can see we have 100. It
creates one new instance or one new

152
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:41,519
creates one new instance or one new
 

153
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,430
creates one new instance or one new
object per frame. So we're going to go

154
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:43,440
object per frame. So we're going to go
 

155
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,910
object per frame. So we're going to go
ahead get a bake node and bake that out.

156
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:47,920
ahead get a bake node and bake that out.
 

157
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,190
ahead get a bake node and bake that out.
So now we can go back to the beginning

158
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:49,200
So now we can go back to the beginning
 

159
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,869
So now we can go back to the beginning
of our timeline and nothing's going to

160
00:02:50,869 --> 00:02:50,879
of our timeline and nothing's going to
 

161
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,030
of our timeline and nothing's going to
change. Now let's go ahead. I'm going to

162
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,040
change. Now let's go ahead. I'm going to
 

163
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,309
change. Now let's go ahead. I'm going to
create a good amount of space because

164
00:02:54,309 --> 00:02:54,319
create a good amount of space because
 

165
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,670
create a good amount of space because
we're going to put some attributes right

166
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:55,680
we're going to put some attributes right
 

167
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,509
we're going to put some attributes right
here later. But for now, let's just go

168
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:57,519
here later. But for now, let's just go
 

169
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,030
here later. But for now, let's just go
ahead and get a

170
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,040
ahead and get a
 

171
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,949
ahead and get a
set

172
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:02,959
set
 

173
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,710
set
position node and let's create the

174
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:04,720
position node and let's create the
 

175
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,430
position node and let's create the
displacement. So, we're going to get a

176
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:07,440
displacement. So, we're going to get a
 

177
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,229
displacement. So, we're going to get a
combine XYZ so that we can just displace

178
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:10,239
combine XYZ so that we can just displace
 

179
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,470
combine XYZ so that we can just displace
on the Z-axis. Let's get a noise texture

180
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:14,480
on the Z-axis. Let's get a noise texture
 

181
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,790
on the Z-axis. Let's get a noise texture
and plug color right into Z. And it's

182
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:16,800
and plug color right into Z. And it's
 

183
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,070
and plug color right into Z. And it's
going to do that. Let's click on

184
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:18,080
going to do that. Let's click on
 

185
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,790
going to do that. Let's click on
normalize and let's get in a vector math

186
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:20,800
normalize and let's get in a vector math
 

187
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,430
normalize and let's get in a vector math
node.

188
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:23,440
node.
 

189
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,670
node.
And let's switch that to scale so that

190
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:25,680
And let's switch that to scale so that
 

191
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,830
And let's switch that to scale so that
we can adjust the strength of this

192
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:27,840
we can adjust the strength of this
 

193
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,830
we can adjust the strength of this
effect. I'm going to give it a scale of

194
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:29,840
effect. I'm going to give it a scale of
 

195
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,670
effect. I'm going to give it a scale of
2.3

196
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:31,680
2.3
 

197
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,750
2.3
to look really cool. Just like that.

198
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:33,760
to look really cool. Just like that.
 

199
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,509
to look really cool. Just like that.
Now, what I want is there to be some

200
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:35,519
Now, what I want is there to be some
 

201
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,350
Now, what I want is there to be some
flat portions of this animation. And

202
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:39,360
flat portions of this animation. And
 

203
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,509
flat portions of this animation. And
normally you can just go ahead get a

204
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:41,519
normally you can just go ahead get a
 

205
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:42,949
normally you can just go ahead get a
color amp and it essentially kind of

206
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:42,959
color amp and it essentially kind of
 

207
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,789
color amp and it essentially kind of
clamps it on the bottom and you get

208
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:44,799
clamps it on the bottom and you get
 

209
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,670
clamps it on the bottom and you get
these nice flat portions. However, uh

210
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:47,680
these nice flat portions. However, uh
 

211
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,789
these nice flat portions. However, uh
it's a really dramatic change from flat

212
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:50,799
it's a really dramatic change from flat
 

213
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,350
it's a really dramatic change from flat
to curve. So, I don't particularly like

214
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:53,360
to curve. So, I don't particularly like
 

215
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,390
to curve. So, I don't particularly like
that. And if you want to get a little

216
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:54,400
that. And if you want to get a little
 

217
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,110
that. And if you want to get a little
bit more advanced on edits like this,

218
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,120
bit more advanced on edits like this,
 

219
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,949
bit more advanced on edits like this,
get a

220
00:03:58,949 --> 00:03:58,959
get a
 

221
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,070
get a
RGB curves node. And then what you can

222
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,080
RGB curves node. And then what you can
 

223
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,710
RGB curves node. And then what you can
do is I'm just going to throw some

224
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:04,720
do is I'm just going to throw some
 

225
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,789
do is I'm just going to throw some
points right here, right here. And then

226
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:06,799
points right here, right here. And then
 

227
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,350
points right here, right here. And then
here, I'm just going to bring this up

228
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:09,360
here, I'm just going to bring this up
 

229
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,229
here, I'm just going to bring this up
just like that. And that is going to

230
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:12,239
just like that. And that is going to
 

231
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,350
just like that. And that is going to
make that uh a little bit flat, but

232
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:15,360
make that uh a little bit flat, but
 

233
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,949
make that uh a little bit flat, but
still have a little bit of nuance. And

234
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:16,959
still have a little bit of nuance. And
 

235
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,469
still have a little bit of nuance. And
then we can just switch this over to

236
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:20,479
then we can just switch this over to
 

237
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:21,909
then we can just switch this over to
we can click on here and switch this

238
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:21,919
we can click on here and switch this
 

239
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:24,550
we can click on here and switch this
over to more of a a harsh straight line.

240
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:24,560
over to more of a a harsh straight line.
 

241
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,550
over to more of a a harsh straight line.
You can even do that on this one. And

242
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:26,560
You can even do that on this one. And
 

243
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,270
You can even do that on this one. And
you get these flat portions but still

244
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:29,280
you get these flat portions but still
 

245
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,310
you get these flat portions but still
have a little bit of wave to them.

246
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:34,320
have a little bit of wave to them.
 

247
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,070
have a little bit of wave to them.
And you can just flatten out all of

248
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:36,080
And you can just flatten out all of
 

249
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,510
And you can just flatten out all of
these until you get some really nice

250
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:39,520
these until you get some really nice
 

251
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,990
these until you get some really nice
looking flat portions of your scene. And

252
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,000
looking flat portions of your scene. And
 

253
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,990
looking flat portions of your scene. And
then you can take the scale and bring up

254
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,000
then you can take the scale and bring up
 

255
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,830
then you can take the scale and bring up
the other portions. And that is going to

256
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:45,840
the other portions. And that is going to
 

257
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,310
the other portions. And that is going to
give you that topographic map inspired

258
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:48,320
give you that topographic map inspired
 

259
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,670
give you that topographic map inspired
look where you have these hills, you

260
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:49,680
look where you have these hills, you
 

261
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,510
look where you have these hills, you
have these flat portions, but still with

262
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:51,520
have these flat portions, but still with
 

263
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,830
have these flat portions, but still with
a little bit of wave to them, which is

264
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:53,840
a little bit of wave to them, which is
 

265
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,469
a little bit of wave to them, which is
really important for the style. And then

266
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:56,479
really important for the style. And then
 

267
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,230
really important for the style. And then
I can go ahead maybe bring my scale out

268
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:58,240
I can go ahead maybe bring my scale out
 

269
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,230
I can go ahead maybe bring my scale out
a little bit more. I still want more

270
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:00,240
a little bit more. I still want more
 

271
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,830
a little bit more. I still want more
flat.

272
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:01,840
flat.
 

273
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,070
flat.
This is pretty cool. So we can bring

274
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,080
This is pretty cool. So we can bring
 

275
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,150
This is pretty cool. So we can bring
that scale up some. So now we're here.

276
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,160
that scale up some. So now we're here.
 

277
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,749
that scale up some. So now we're here.
We can go ahead and start adding

278
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:07,759
We can go ahead and start adding
 

279
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,550
We can go ahead and start adding
materials. So, I'm going to go ahead get

280
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:10,560
materials. So, I'm going to go ahead get
 

281
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,150
materials. So, I'm going to go ahead get
a set material node right over here.

282
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160
a set material node right over here.
 

283
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,430
a set material node right over here.
We're going to click new and I'm just

284
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:15,440
We're going to click new and I'm just
 

285
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,070
We're going to click new and I'm just
going to call this

286
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,080
going to call this
 

287
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,350
going to call this
light. You can call it whatever you

288
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:19,360
light. You can call it whatever you
 

289
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,990
light. You can call it whatever you
want. And then grab it here. So, right

290
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,000
want. And then grab it here. So, right
 

291
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,270
want. And then grab it here. So, right
before the material, we're going to go

292
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:23,280
before the material, we're going to go
 

293
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,909
before the material, we're going to go
ahead and get a

294
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:25,919
ahead and get a
 

295
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,909
ahead and get a
curve to mesh node. And we need to get a

296
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:29,919
curve to mesh node. And we need to get a
 

297
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,510
curve to mesh node. And we need to get a
circle. We're going to get a curve

298
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:31,520
circle. We're going to get a curve
 

299
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,990
circle. We're going to get a curve
circle node to define um the width of

300
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,000
circle node to define um the width of
 

301
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,590
circle node to define um the width of
the tubes. So, we're going to plug that

302
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:37,600
the tubes. So, we're going to plug that
 

303
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,110
the tubes. So, we're going to plug that
there. I'm going to do a resolution of

304
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:39,120
there. I'm going to do a resolution of
 

305
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,270
there. I'm going to do a resolution of
three and a radius of 0.001

306
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:43,280
three and a radius of 0.001
 

307
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,189
three and a radius of 0.001
for now. And we will make that thinner

308
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:45,199
for now. And we will make that thinner
 

309
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,550
for now. And we will make that thinner
later, but I want it big enough so we

310
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,560
later, but I want it big enough so we
 

311
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,150
later, but I want it big enough so we
can see the materials as we're editing

312
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:48,160
can see the materials as we're editing
 

313
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,670
can see the materials as we're editing
them. So now we have geometry. So if I

314
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:51,680
them. So now we have geometry. So if I
 

315
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,909
them. So now we have geometry. So if I
go over here to the shader and I click

316
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:53,919
go over here to the shader and I click
 

317
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,189
go over here to the shader and I click
on the light, I'm going to switch this

318
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:55,199
on the light, I'm going to switch this
 

319
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,150
on the light, I'm going to switch this
over to an emission node and then I'm

320
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,160
over to an emission node and then I'm
 

321
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,550
over to an emission node and then I'm
going to switch over to the EV engine

322
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:00,560
going to switch over to the EV engine
 

323
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,950
going to switch over to the EV engine
and let's look at it. So we have this

324
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:02,960
and let's look at it. So we have this
 

325
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,950
and let's look at it. So we have this
going on here. What I'll do is I'm going

326
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:04,960
going on here. What I'll do is I'm going
 

327
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,189
going on here. What I'll do is I'm going
to make this a little smaller so we can

328
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:07,199
to make this a little smaller so we can
 

329
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,270
to make this a little smaller so we can
just look at it here. And then I'm going

330
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:09,280
just look at it here. And then I'm going
 

331
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,590
just look at it here. And then I'm going
to bring up a new window. So I'm going

332
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:11,600
to bring up a new window. So I'm going
 

333
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,749
to bring up a new window. So I'm going
to keep geometry nodes up here and I'm

334
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:13,759
to keep geometry nodes up here and I'm
 

335
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,469
to keep geometry nodes up here and I'm
going to put the shading here. And let's

336
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:16,479
going to put the shading here. And let's
 

337
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,350
going to put the shading here. And let's
go ahead and plug a wave texture and a

338
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:19,360
go ahead and plug a wave texture and a
 

339
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,270
go ahead and plug a wave texture and a
color ramp into the color here on the

340
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:21,280
color ramp into the color here on the
 

341
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,550
color ramp into the color here on the
emission. So do a wave texture. And we

342
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:24,560
emission. So do a wave texture. And we
 

343
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,749
emission. So do a wave texture. And we
won't need a mapping because we're going

344
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:25,759
won't need a mapping because we're going
 

345
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,070
won't need a mapping because we're going
to do an attribute instead. So just plug

346
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,080
to do an attribute instead. So just plug
 

347
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,710
to do an attribute instead. So just plug
color right into color ramp. And notice

348
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:30,720
color right into color ramp. And notice
 

349
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,510
color right into color ramp. And notice
our first problem. this right here.

350
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:33,520
our first problem. this right here.
 

351
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,309
our first problem. this right here.
Notice how the wave uh it's it's going

352
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:36,319
Notice how the wave uh it's it's going
 

353
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,790
Notice how the wave uh it's it's going
across and even if I switch this over to

354
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:38,800
across and even if I switch this over to
 

355
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,790
across and even if I switch this over to
uh bands, it's still not going to

356
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:40,800
uh bands, it's still not going to
 

357
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,550
uh bands, it's still not going to
respect the direction of the curves

358
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:42,560
respect the direction of the curves
 

359
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,189
respect the direction of the curves
themselves. So, the way you can fix that

360
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:45,199
themselves. So, the way you can fix that
 

361
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,070
themselves. So, the way you can fix that
is right before the set position is

362
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,080
is right before the set position is
 

363
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,670
is right before the set position is
right before the set position, we're

364
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:49,680
right before the set position, we're
 

365
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,550
right before the set position, we're
going to add two attributes. So, we're

366
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:52,560
going to add two attributes. So, we're
 

367
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,110
going to add two attributes. So, we're
going to get a store named attribute.

368
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,120
going to get a store named attribute.
 

369
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,029
going to get a store named attribute.
We're going to get two of them. So, the

370
00:06:57,029 --> 00:06:57,039
We're going to get two of them. So, the
 

371
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,909
We're going to get two of them. So, the
first one is going to be a

372
00:06:59,909 --> 00:06:59,919
first one is going to be a
 

373
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,469
first one is going to be a
spline parameter node. And what is he is

374
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:02,479
spline parameter node. And what is he is
 

375
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:03,990
spline parameter node. And what is he is
going to be able to do is to tell the

376
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,000
going to be able to do is to tell the
 

377
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,670
going to be able to do is to tell the
shading which direction the curves are

378
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:05,680
shading which direction the curves are
 

379
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,350
shading which direction the curves are
going essentially at least at least from

380
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:07,360
going essentially at least at least from
 

381
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,510
going essentially at least at least from
a visual standpoint. So we'll plug

382
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:09,520
a visual standpoint. So we'll plug
 

383
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,270
a visual standpoint. So we'll plug
factor into value and we'll just name

384
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:11,280
factor into value and we'll just name
 

385
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,469
factor into value and we'll just name
them S for um spline. And then we're I

386
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:14,479
them S for um spline. And then we're I
 

387
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,070
them S for um spline. And then we're I
want to add some randomness to the um

388
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,080
want to add some randomness to the um
 

389
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,510
want to add some randomness to the um
phase offset. So we're going to get a

390
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:21,520
phase offset. So we're going to get a
 

391
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,990
phase offset. So we're going to get a
random value node. I want to add a

392
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:24,000
random value node. I want to add a
 

393
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,070
random value node. I want to add a
random value per curve. So we're going

394
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,080
random value per curve. So we're going
 

395
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,309
random value per curve. So we're going
to go from points to splines and then

396
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:28,319
to go from points to splines and then
 

397
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,990
to go from points to splines and then
plug that into the value. I'm just going

398
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,000
plug that into the value. I'm just going
 

399
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,230
plug that into the value. I'm just going
to call this R for random. So that's all

400
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:32,240
to call this R for random. So that's all
 

401
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,270
to call this R for random. So that's all
we're going to need to play with here.

402
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:33,280
we're going to need to play with here.
 

403
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,070
we're going to need to play with here.
So I can just go ahead and delete this

404
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,080
So I can just go ahead and delete this
 

405
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,150
So I can just go ahead and delete this
and we can get two attribute nodes. One

406
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:40,160
and we can get two attribute nodes. One
 

407
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,790
and we can get two attribute nodes. One
with the name R, one with the name S. So

408
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:42,800
with the name R, one with the name S. So
 

409
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,790
with the name R, one with the name S. So
the one with the name S is the is the

410
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:44,800
the one with the name S is the is the
 

411
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,710
the one with the name S is the is the
spline. So we'll plug factor into vector

412
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:46,720
spline. So we'll plug factor into vector
 

413
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,670
spline. So we'll plug factor into vector
and immediately it is going to respect

414
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:49,680
and immediately it is going to respect
 

415
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,749
and immediately it is going to respect
the direction of the curves, which is

416
00:07:51,749 --> 00:07:51,759
the direction of the curves, which is
 

417
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,909
the direction of the curves, which is
really really nice. And then just to

418
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:53,919
really really nice. And then just to
 

419
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,270
really really nice. And then just to
make it look cooler, I'm going to go

420
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:55,280
make it look cooler, I'm going to go
 

421
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,670
make it look cooler, I'm going to go
from sign to saw. And it is going to

422
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:57,680
from sign to saw. And it is going to
 

423
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,430
from sign to saw. And it is going to
give the back end of it this really

424
00:07:59,430 --> 00:07:59,440
give the back end of it this really
 

425
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,830
give the back end of it this really
faded uh faded edge and the front this

426
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:01,840
faded uh faded edge and the front this
 

427
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,150
faded uh faded edge and the front this
hard edge. So that when I bring in my

428
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,160
hard edge. So that when I bring in my
 

429
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,150
hard edge. So that when I bring in my
color ramp, uh you can have some fun.

430
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:06,160
color ramp, uh you can have some fun.
 

431
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,350
color ramp, uh you can have some fun.
And then I'm going to just go bring my

432
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:07,360
And then I'm going to just go bring my
 

433
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,029
And then I'm going to just go bring my
world brightness down to black. So this

434
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:09,039
world brightness down to black. So this
 

435
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,350
world brightness down to black. So this
is a little bit more of an obvious edit.

436
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:11,360
is a little bit more of an obvious edit.
 

437
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,670
is a little bit more of an obvious edit.
You can see that's how it looks now. It

438
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:13,680
You can see that's how it looks now. It
 

439
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,469
You can see that's how it looks now. It
looks pretty cool. Now what I want to do

440
00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:16,479
looks pretty cool. Now what I want to do
 

441
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,869
looks pretty cool. Now what I want to do
is you notice how all of the waves are

442
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:18,879
is you notice how all of the waves are
 

443
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,990
is you notice how all of the waves are
in line with each other. I want to

444
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:22,000
in line with each other. I want to
 

445
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,029
in line with each other. I want to
randomize the position or how you know

446
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:25,039
randomize the position or how you know
 

447
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,189
randomize the position or how you know
where this is rotating per curve. And so

448
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:27,199
where this is rotating per curve. And so
 

449
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,510
where this is rotating per curve. And so
we created a random value per curve

450
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:29,520
we created a random value per curve
 

451
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,990
we created a random value per curve
attribute right here. So if I plug

452
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:32,000
attribute right here. So if I plug
 

453
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,709
attribute right here. So if I plug
factor into phase offset, see how it's

454
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:34,719
factor into phase offset, see how it's
 

455
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,469
factor into phase offset, see how it's
doing that? It's moving that. It's

456
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:36,479
doing that? It's moving that. It's
 

457
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,269
doing that? It's moving that. It's
giving it a unique value for each curve.

458
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:39,279
giving it a unique value for each curve.
 

459
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,870
giving it a unique value for each curve.
But it's not dramatic enough. I mean,

460
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:40,880
But it's not dramatic enough. I mean,
 

461
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,310
But it's not dramatic enough. I mean,
that might be cool. That's definitely a

462
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:42,320
that might be cool. That's definitely a
 

463
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,990
that might be cool. That's definitely a
cool look. I want it to be a little bit

464
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,000
cool look. I want it to be a little bit
 

465
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,870
cool look. I want it to be a little bit
more dramatic. So, I'm going to go ahead

466
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:46,880
more dramatic. So, I'm going to go ahead
 

467
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,829
more dramatic. So, I'm going to go ahead
and get a math node and switch it to

468
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:49,839
and get a math node and switch it to
 

469
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,710
and get a math node and switch it to
multiply add. I want to do a multiply so

470
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:52,720
multiply add. I want to do a multiply so
 

471
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,590
multiply add. I want to do a multiply so
I can multiply this effect to make it

472
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:55,600
I can multiply this effect to make it
 

473
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,590
I can multiply this effect to make it
look more like that and then add so we

474
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:57,600
look more like that and then add so we
 

475
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,389
look more like that and then add so we
can still animate all of them moving um

476
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:00,399
can still animate all of them moving um
 

477
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,870
can still animate all of them moving um
in a circle. So, one thing you can do to

478
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:02,880
in a circle. So, one thing you can do to
 

479
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,269
in a circle. So, one thing you can do to
edit this uh this look a little bit is

480
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:05,279
edit this uh this look a little bit is
 

481
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,790
edit this uh this look a little bit is
see how you can do that bring it all the

482
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:06,800
see how you can do that bring it all the
 

483
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,710
see how you can do that bring it all the
way down to this little point and then

484
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:08,720
way down to this little point and then
 

485
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,389
way down to this little point and then
you can use the add and animate these

486
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:10,399
you can use the add and animate these
 

487
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,990
you can use the add and animate these
guys around. What you can do is go ahead

488
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,000
guys around. What you can do is go ahead
 

489
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,710
guys around. What you can do is go ahead
and make this white as well. And then

490
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:16,720
and make this white as well. And then
 

491
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,710
and make this white as well. And then
get a new node and make him black. And

492
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:20,720
get a new node and make him black. And
 

493
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,470
get a new node and make him black. And
so now what we can do is bring him in

494
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:22,480
so now what we can do is bring him in
 

495
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,190
so now what we can do is bring him in
like this. Now what we can do is make

496
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:25,200
like this. Now what we can do is make
 

497
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:31,990
like this. Now what we can do is make
him a darker color and then bring it in

498
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:32,000
him a darker color and then bring it in
 

499
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,790
him a darker color and then bring it in
and make it much darker. Something like

500
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:34,800
and make it much darker. Something like
 

501
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,350
and make it much darker. Something like
this. So that the tips of each one of

502
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:37,360
this. So that the tips of each one of
 

503
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,590
this. So that the tips of each one of
these lines is brighter. And then it

504
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:39,600
these lines is brighter. And then it
 

505
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,870
these lines is brighter. And then it
goes from black from gray and then into

506
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:42,880
goes from black from gray and then into
 

507
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,550
goes from black from gray and then into
black like that. So it looks really

508
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:44,560
black like that. So it looks really
 

509
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,310
black like that. So it looks really
really cool. So you can do something

510
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:46,320
really cool. So you can do something
 

511
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,829
really cool. So you can do something
like this and get this really cool

512
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:47,839
like this and get this really cool
 

513
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,910
like this and get this really cool
effect. And then you can bring up your

514
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:49,920
effect. And then you can bring up your
 

515
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,509
effect. And then you can bring up your
strength

516
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:51,519
strength
 

517
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,509
strength
and then bring that down a little bit

518
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:53,519
and then bring that down a little bit
 

519
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,910
and then bring that down a little bit
more so that we can have a more obvious

520
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:55,920
more so that we can have a more obvious
 

521
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,070
more so that we can have a more obvious
effect. And then I'm going to go here to

522
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:58,080
effect. And then I'm going to go here to
 

523
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,150
effect. And then I'm going to go here to
the compositing window up here. Click

524
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:00,160
the compositing window up here. Click
 

525
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,910
the compositing window up here. Click
use nodes. Get a glare node and switch

526
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:03,920
use nodes. Get a glare node and switch
 

527
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,110
use nodes. Get a glare node and switch
it over to a fog glow. And then we can

528
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,120
it over to a fog glow. And then we can
 

529
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,829
it over to a fog glow. And then we can
go back to the geometry notes window

530
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:09,839
go back to the geometry notes window
 

531
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,269
go back to the geometry notes window
right up here. We can switch it to

532
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:11,279
right up here. We can switch it to
 

533
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,269
right up here. We can switch it to
always. And now we can see, okay, our

534
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:13,279
always. And now we can see, okay, our
 

535
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,829
always. And now we can see, okay, our
glow is working. And then when we uh use

536
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:15,839
glow is working. And then when we uh use
 

537
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,910
glow is working. And then when we uh use
the addend, we can see, okay, we can

538
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:17,920
the addend, we can see, okay, we can
 

539
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,190
the addend, we can see, okay, we can
move these guys around. Now, if you want

540
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:21,200
move these guys around. Now, if you want
 

541
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,110
move these guys around. Now, if you want
to change the color, you can get a mix

542
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,120
to change the color, you can get a mix
 

543
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,230
to change the color, you can get a mix
color node. Put this on the factor.

544
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,240
color node. Put this on the factor.
 

545
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,870
color node. Put this on the factor.
Bring this. Bring the top one down to

546
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:30,880
Bring this. Bring the top one down to
 

547
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,230
Bring this. Bring the top one down to
black and the bottom one. Choose any

548
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,240
black and the bottom one. Choose any
 

549
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,829
black and the bottom one. Choose any
color you want. So, I'm going to go with

550
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:35,839
color you want. So, I'm going to go with
 

551
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,750
color you want. So, I'm going to go with
something

552
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:37,760
something
 

553
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,470
something
something cool like this. Cool. So, now

554
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:40,480
something cool like this. Cool. So, now
 

555
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,509
something cool like this. Cool. So, now
we have this. Now, before we animate and

556
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:43,519
we have this. Now, before we animate and
 

557
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,269
we have this. Now, before we animate and
finish this off, one thing I want to

558
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:45,279
finish this off, one thing I want to
 

559
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,949
finish this off, one thing I want to
notice is all of these are animating at

560
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:48,959
notice is all of these are animating at
 

561
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,269
notice is all of these are animating at
the same speed at the same time using

562
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:51,279
the same speed at the same time using
 

563
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,630
the same speed at the same time using
this addend uh slider here. But what I

564
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:54,640
this addend uh slider here. But what I
 

565
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,870
this addend uh slider here. But what I
want is I want some of these uh curves I

566
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:58,880
want is I want some of these uh curves I
 

567
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,710
want is I want some of these uh curves I
want some of them to be faster and some

568
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:00,720
want some of them to be faster and some
 

569
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,870
want some of them to be faster and some
of them to be slower than others. And I

570
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:02,880
of them to be slower than others. And I
 

571
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,630
of them to be slower than others. And I
still want to animate this in a loop,

572
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:04,640
still want to animate this in a loop,
 

573
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,389
still want to animate this in a loop,
but I don't like that they're all going

574
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:06,399
but I don't like that they're all going
 

575
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,150
but I don't like that they're all going
the same. To me, it doesn't make it look

576
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:08,160
the same. To me, it doesn't make it look
 

577
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,389
the same. To me, it doesn't make it look
alive enough, similar to the way it

578
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:10,399
alive enough, similar to the way it
 

579
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,110
alive enough, similar to the way it
looks alive in my animation. So, here's

580
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:13,120
looks alive in my animation. So, here's
 

581
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,910
looks alive in my animation. So, here's
what we can do. I can get two materials.

582
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:15,920
what we can do. I can get two materials.
 

583
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,990
what we can do. I can get two materials.
One where the animation is going a

584
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,000
One where the animation is going a
 

585
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,150
One where the animation is going a
certain speed, and the other material

586
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:20,160
certain speed, and the other material
 

587
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,230
certain speed, and the other material
where it's going faster than the other

588
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:22,240
where it's going faster than the other
 

589
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,150
where it's going faster than the other
one. And I need to be able to assign

590
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:24,160
one. And I need to be able to assign
 

591
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,389
one. And I need to be able to assign
that to random ones. So, here's what we

592
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:26,399
that to random ones. So, here's what we
 

593
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,630
that to random ones. So, here's what we
can do. I can go back to the geometry

594
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:28,640
can do. I can go back to the geometry
 

595
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,790
can do. I can go back to the geometry
nodes editor

596
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:30,800
nodes editor
 

597
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,990
nodes editor
right here. And then right after the set

598
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,000
right here. And then right after the set
 

599
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,509
right here. And then right after the set
position right here, we're going to go

600
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:35,519
position right here, we're going to go
 

601
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,790
position right here, we're going to go
ahead and separate all of the curves so

602
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:38,800
ahead and separate all of the curves so
 

603
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,949
ahead and separate all of the curves so
I can assign two different materials.

604
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:40,959
I can assign two different materials.
 

605
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,790
I can assign two different materials.
One here and another one. So let's go

606
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:42,800
One here and another one. So let's go
 

607
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,710
One here and another one. So let's go
ahead and get a separate geometry node.

608
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:46,720
ahead and get a separate geometry node.
 

609
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,870
ahead and get a separate geometry node.
And we're going to say separate splines.

610
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:48,880
And we're going to say separate splines.
 

611
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,190
And we're going to say separate splines.
I'm going to get a

612
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:51,200
I'm going to get a
 

613
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,430
I'm going to get a
random value node and switch it to

614
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:53,440
random value node and switch it to
 

615
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,350
random value node and switch it to
boolean. That's going to make a slider.

616
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:55,360
boolean. That's going to make a slider.
 

617
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,630
boolean. That's going to make a slider.
So what's going to happen is if I plug

618
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:56,640
So what's going to happen is if I plug
 

619
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,990
So what's going to happen is if I plug
this into the selection, you'll notice

620
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:58,000
this into the selection, you'll notice
 

621
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,230
this into the selection, you'll notice
some of these start to delete. We're

622
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:00,240
some of these start to delete. We're
 

623
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,230
some of these start to delete. We're
deleting them. So I'm going to do 0.5.

624
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:02,240
deleting them. So I'm going to do 0.5.
 

625
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,470
deleting them. So I'm going to do 0.5.
So that means exactly we're deleting

626
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:04,480
So that means exactly we're deleting
 

627
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,670
So that means exactly we're deleting
half of them uh randomly. What this

628
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:07,680
half of them uh randomly. What this
 

629
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,550
half of them uh randomly. What this
means is now we have access to the ones

630
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:10,560
means is now we have access to the ones
 

631
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,550
means is now we have access to the ones
that we deleted through this inverted

632
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:12,560
that we deleted through this inverted
 

633
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,990
that we deleted through this inverted
output. So what I can do is I can take

634
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:16,000
output. So what I can do is I can take
 

635
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,949
output. So what I can do is I can take
these nodes here, hit control shift D or

636
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:18,959
these nodes here, hit control shift D or
 

637
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,430
these nodes here, hit control shift D or
just um duplicate them and connect the

638
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:21,440
just um duplicate them and connect the
 

639
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,470
just um duplicate them and connect the
inverted to the curve up here.

640
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:26,480

 

641
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,310

And then we're going to get a join

642
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:28,320
And then we're going to get a join
 

643
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,910
And then we're going to get a join
geometry.

644
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:29,920
geometry.
 

645
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,030
geometry.
And then watch, we're going to bring

646
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,040
And then watch, we're going to bring
 

647
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,310
And then watch, we're going to bring
them right back. So now

648
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:34,320
them right back. So now
 

649
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,389
them right back. So now
the ones that we separated are are um

650
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:38,399
the ones that we separated are are um
 

651
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,389
the ones that we separated are are um
you seen here, here, and here. And you

652
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:40,399
you seen here, here, and here. And you
 

653
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,590
you seen here, here, and here. And you
can notice, say I can bring up the

654
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:41,600
can notice, say I can bring up the
 

655
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,389
can notice, say I can bring up the
radius of some of them. See that? So now

656
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:44,399
radius of some of them. See that? So now
 

657
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,310
radius of some of them. See that? So now
the radius of some of them I can change

658
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:46,320
the radius of some of them I can change
 

659
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,750
the radius of some of them I can change
and other ones I don't. So they're

660
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:47,760
and other ones I don't. So they're
 

661
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,389
and other ones I don't. So they're
they're separated, which also means we

662
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:50,399
they're separated, which also means we
 

663
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,949
they're separated, which also means we
can make a separate material for each

664
00:12:52,949 --> 00:12:52,959
can make a separate material for each
 

665
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,949
can make a separate material for each
one. So, right over here where it says

666
00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:54,959
one. So, right over here where it says
 

667
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,790
one. So, right over here where it says
light, I'm going to hit the plus icon.

668
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:56,800
light, I'm going to hit the plus icon.
 

669
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,870
light, I'm going to hit the plus icon.
Hit this drop down. Click light. And

670
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:58,880
Hit this drop down. Click light. And
 

671
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,470
Hit this drop down. Click light. And
then I'm here. This number four, I'm

672
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:00,480
then I'm here. This number four, I'm
 

673
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,509
then I'm here. This number four, I'm
just going to click that. It's going to

674
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:01,519
just going to click that. It's going to
 

675
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,590
just going to click that. It's going to
make a duplicate of the material we

676
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:03,600
make a duplicate of the material we
 

677
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,790
make a duplicate of the material we
made. And I'm just going to call this

678
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:04,800
made. And I'm just going to call this
 

679
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,470
made. And I'm just going to call this
light

680
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:06,480
light
 

681
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,350
light
two. And grab light two here. So now

682
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:09,360
two. And grab light two here. So now
 

683
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,430
two. And grab light two here. So now
it's a literal duplicate of the material

684
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:11,440
it's a literal duplicate of the material
 

685
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,710
it's a literal duplicate of the material
that we just created. So when we go back

686
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:14,720
that we just created. So when we go back
 

687
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,550
that we just created. So when we go back
to

688
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:18,560

 

689
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,190

the shader editor, you can see slot one.

690
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:21,200
the shader editor, you can see slot one.
 

691
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,269
the shader editor, you can see slot one.
So light two. Watch what happens when we

692
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:23,279
So light two. Watch what happens when we
 

693
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,790
So light two. Watch what happens when we
play with the addendent. Some of them

694
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:24,800
play with the addendent. Some of them
 

695
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,629
play with the addendent. Some of them
aren't moving.

696
00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:26,639
aren't moving.
 

697
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,910
aren't moving.
So, that's pretty cool. So, we can

698
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:27,920
So, that's pretty cool. So, we can
 

699
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,350
So, that's pretty cool. So, we can
animate them at different speeds when

700
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:29,360
animate them at different speeds when
 

701
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,949
animate them at different speeds when
we're ready to animate. What I want to

702
00:13:30,949 --> 00:13:30,959
we're ready to animate. What I want to
 

703
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,949
we're ready to animate. What I want to
do is on some of these just make them

704
00:13:32,949 --> 00:13:32,959
do is on some of these just make them
 

705
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,550
do is on some of these just make them
brighter than others just to give it a

706
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:34,560
brighter than others just to give it a
 

707
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,790
brighter than others just to give it a
little bit more of that randomness

708
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:36,800
little bit more of that randomness
 

709
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,030
little bit more of that randomness
uh look. I mean, you can even change the

710
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:39,040
uh look. I mean, you can even change the
 

711
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,150
uh look. I mean, you can even change the
color of some of them, too, if you want

712
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:40,160
color of some of them, too, if you want
 

713
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,470
color of some of them, too, if you want
to have some fun and uh make it look

714
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:42,480
to have some fun and uh make it look
 

715
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,389
to have some fun and uh make it look
awesome. You could do anything you want.

716
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:44,399
awesome. You could do anything you want.
 

717
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,870
awesome. You could do anything you want.
Have a lot of fun. And uh I'm just going

718
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:46,880
Have a lot of fun. And uh I'm just going
 

719
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,470
Have a lot of fun. And uh I'm just going
to make some of them darker. And then

720
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:48,480
to make some of them darker. And then
 

721
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,750
to make some of them darker. And then
I'm going to switch over to slot one,

722
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:49,760
I'm going to switch over to slot one,
 

723
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,030
I'm going to switch over to slot one,
the light, and make some of them

724
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,040
the light, and make some of them
 

725
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,389
the light, and make some of them
brighter.

726
00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:52,399
brighter.
 

727
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,190
brighter.
so we can add more randomness to how

728
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:55,200
so we can add more randomness to how
 

729
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,430
so we can add more randomness to how
this looks. So, let's just go ahead and

730
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:57,440
this looks. So, let's just go ahead and
 

731
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,629
this looks. So, let's just go ahead and
animate them. So, I'm going to give

732
00:13:58,629 --> 00:13:58,639
animate them. So, I'm going to give
 

733
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,509
animate them. So, I'm going to give
myself 400 frames. I'm going to go back

734
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:01,519
myself 400 frames. I'm going to go back
 

735
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,189
myself 400 frames. I'm going to go back
to frame zero and we're going to animate

736
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:03,199
to frame zero and we're going to animate
 

737
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,509
to frame zero and we're going to animate
this in a loop. So, I'm going to go back

738
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:05,519
this in a loop. So, I'm going to go back
 

739
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,069
this in a loop. So, I'm going to go back
here to the addend and go to zero.

740
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:08,079
here to the addend and go to zero.
 

741
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:09,590
here to the addend and go to zero.
Because we want this to be a loop, we're

742
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:09,600
Because we want this to be a loop, we're
 

743
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,430
Because we want this to be a loop, we're
going to use pi. So, I'm going to hit I

744
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:11,440
going to use pi. So, I'm going to hit I
 

745
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,189
going to use pi. So, I'm going to hit I
on the addend, go to the end, and I'm

746
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:13,199
on the addend, go to the end, and I'm
 

747
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:17,110
on the addend, go to the end, and I'm
going to type in -10*

748
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:17,120
going to type in -10*
 

749
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,910
going to type in -10*
or asterisk pi. We're doing negative 10

750
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:19,920
or asterisk pi. We're doing negative 10
 

751
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,310
or asterisk pi. We're doing negative 10
because um if you do a positive 10,

752
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:22,320
because um if you do a positive 10,
 

753
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,750
because um if you do a positive 10,
it'll look like it's going backwards. So

754
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:23,760
it'll look like it's going backwards. So
 

755
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,870
it'll look like it's going backwards. So
that's the only reason why we're doing

756
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:24,880
that's the only reason why we're doing
 

757
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,189
that's the only reason why we're doing
that. So now we have one animating at a

758
00:14:27,189 --> 00:14:27,199
that. So now we have one animating at a
 

759
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,509
that. So now we have one animating at a
nice like slow pace. We're going to go

760
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:29,519
nice like slow pace. We're going to go
 

761
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,470
nice like slow pace. We're going to go
to slot two, which is light two. I'm

762
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:32,480
to slot two, which is light two. I'm
 

763
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,990
to slot two, which is light two. I'm
going to go back to frame zero on the

764
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:34,000
going to go back to frame zero on the
 

765
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,590
going to go back to frame zero on the
addend. Make sure it's at zero. I'm

766
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:35,600
addend. Make sure it's at zero. I'm
 

767
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,269
addend. Make sure it's at zero. I'm
going hit I. I'm going to do

768
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:39,279
going hit I. I'm going to do
 

769
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,990
going hit I. I'm going to do
I'm going to do -4

770
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:42,000
I'm going to do -4
 

771
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,790
I'm going to do -4
asterisk pi.

772
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:44,800
asterisk pi.
 

773
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,870
asterisk pi.
And now some of them are traveling

774
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:46,880
And now some of them are traveling
 

775
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,829
And now some of them are traveling
faster than others, which is going to

776
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:49,839
faster than others, which is going to
 

777
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,790
faster than others, which is going to
give it this more alive uh look. So now

778
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:52,800
give it this more alive uh look. So now
 

779
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,870
give it this more alive uh look. So now
we have this. We're done with the

780
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:54,880
we have this. We're done with the
 

781
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,790
we have this. We're done with the
animation. Let's just go ahead and

782
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:56,800
animation. Let's just go ahead and
 

783
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,550
animation. Let's just go ahead and
create a grid floor for the bottom.

784
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:00,560
create a grid floor for the bottom.
 

785
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,389
create a grid floor for the bottom.
So I'm going to go and just get my

786
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:02,399
So I'm going to go and just get my
 

787
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,910
So I'm going to go and just get my
camera. So I'm hit shift A camera. And

788
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:05,920
camera. So I'm hit shift A camera. And
 

789
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,269
camera. So I'm hit shift A camera. And
then I'm going to hit G and middle

790
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:07,279
then I'm going to hit G and middle
 

791
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,150
then I'm going to hit G and middle
click. I'm going to go up

792
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:10,160
click. I'm going to go up
 

793
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,829
click. I'm going to go up
and then then I'm going to hit RX.

794
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:13,839
and then then I'm going to hit RX.
 

795
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,189
and then then I'm going to hit RX.
Looks like I need to go up a little bit

796
00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:15,199
Looks like I need to go up a little bit
 

797
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,470
Looks like I need to go up a little bit
more. RX.

798
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:18,480
more. RX.
 

799
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,829
more. RX.
And then I'll just go ahead and zoom in

800
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:21,839
And then I'll just go ahead and zoom in
 

801
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,710
And then I'll just go ahead and zoom in
so that we can have a nice camera angle

802
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:24,720
so that we can have a nice camera angle
 

803
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,629
so that we can have a nice camera angle
on this. Now, I want the floor to have a

804
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:26,639
on this. Now, I want the floor to have a
 

805
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,710
on this. Now, I want the floor to have a
nice grid cuz I just don't like like a

806
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:28,720
nice grid cuz I just don't like like a
 

807
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,670
nice grid cuz I just don't like like a
plain black background. I think it looks

808
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:31,680
plain black background. I think it looks
 

809
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,470
plain black background. I think it looks
kind of lame depending. It's not always

810
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:34,480
kind of lame depending. It's not always
 

811
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,829
kind of lame depending. It's not always
lame. So, I'm going to go ahead and get

812
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:35,839
lame. So, I'm going to go ahead and get
 

813
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,150
lame. So, I'm going to go ahead and get
a mesh plane. And I'm going to scale it

814
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:38,160
a mesh plane. And I'm going to scale it
 

815
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,629
a mesh plane. And I'm going to scale it
up

816
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:40,639
up
 

817
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,310
up
so it fits the screen. And then we're

818
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:42,320
so it fits the screen. And then we're
 

819
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,470
so it fits the screen. And then we're
going to go back to the geometry nodes

820
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:44,480
going to go back to the geometry nodes
 

821
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,750
going to go back to the geometry nodes
editor because we have the shader editor

822
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:45,760
editor because we have the shader editor
 

823
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,509
editor because we have the shader editor
opening there. And I'm going to get a

824
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:47,519
opening there. And I'm going to get a
 

825
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,430
opening there. And I'm going to get a
new material. Hit period to bring it

826
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:49,440
new material. Hit period to bring it
 

827
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,629
new material. Hit period to bring it
here. Get an emission of like three.

828
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:52,639
here. Get an emission of like three.
 

829
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,629
here. Get an emission of like three.
We're going to get a color ramp.

830
00:15:56,629 --> 00:15:56,639
We're going to get a color ramp.
 

831
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,710
We're going to get a color ramp.
And we're going to get in a voronoid

832
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:58,720
And we're going to get in a voronoid
 

833
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,870
And we're going to get in a voronoid
texture. And then we're going to plug

834
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:00,880
texture. And then we're going to plug
 

835
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,749
texture. And then we're going to plug
distance into the color ramp. Bring the

836
00:16:03,749 --> 00:16:03,759
distance into the color ramp. Bring the
 

837
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,269
distance into the color ramp. Bring the
random to zero. And then I'm going to

838
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:05,279
random to zero. And then I'm going to
 

839
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,790
random to zero. And then I'm going to
bring in my color ramp like that. So

840
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:06,800
bring in my color ramp like that. So
 

841
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,870
bring in my color ramp like that. So
let's bring up the scale.

842
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:10,880

 

843
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,509

And then I'm going to go to chvby chev

844
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:13,519
And then I'm going to go to chvby chev
 

845
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,350
And then I'm going to go to chvby chev
on the pattern.

846
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:15,360
on the pattern.
 

847
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,230
on the pattern.
And then

848
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:20,240

 

849
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,670

just going to play with the color ramp.

850
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:21,680
just going to play with the color ramp.
 

851
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,030
just going to play with the color ramp.
So bring it in like that. Bring the

852
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:23,040
So bring it in like that. Bring the
 

853
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,430
So bring it in like that. Bring the
white far to the left. And then we'll

854
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:25,440
white far to the left. And then we'll
 

855
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,990
white far to the left. And then we'll
just bring it in like this. And then

856
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:28,000
just bring it in like this. And then
 

857
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,550
just bring it in like this. And then
make the white portion blue like the

858
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:30,560
make the white portion blue like the
 

859
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,949
make the white portion blue like the
floor. Bring it up a little bit. We can

860
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:32,959
floor. Bring it up a little bit. We can
 

861
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,069
floor. Bring it up a little bit. We can
even make this a little bit

862
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:36,079
even make this a little bit
 

863
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,030
even make this a little bit
the line a little bit smaller.

864
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:39,040
the line a little bit smaller.
 

865
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,110
the line a little bit smaller.
So now

866
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:41,120
So now
 

867
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,910
So now
when I render this, we have this nice

868
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:43,920
when I render this, we have this nice
 

869
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,870
when I render this, we have this nice
grid floor for the bottom. So we are

870
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:46,880
grid floor for the bottom. So we are
 

871
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,310
grid floor for the bottom. So we are
completely done and we are going to be

872
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:48,320
completely done and we are going to be
 

873
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,470
completely done and we are going to be
rendering this in Eevee. If you don't

874
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:50,480
rendering this in Eevee. If you don't
 

875
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,749
rendering this in Eevee. If you don't
want to use Eevee and actually want to

876
00:16:51,749 --> 00:16:51,759
want to use Eevee and actually want to
 

877
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,030
want to use Eevee and actually want to
use cycles, you can have a little bit

878
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,040
use cycles, you can have a little bit
 

879
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,189
use cycles, you can have a little bit
more fun and actually get a little bit

880
00:16:55,189 --> 00:16:55,199
more fun and actually get a little bit
 

881
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,629
more fun and actually get a little bit
of reflection on the ground. So you can

882
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:56,639
of reflection on the ground. So you can
 

883
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,749
of reflection on the ground. So you can
make the bottom metallic, no reflection,

884
00:16:59,749 --> 00:16:59,759
make the bottom metallic, no reflection,
 

885
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:00,870
make the bottom metallic, no reflection,
and you can have a little bit of

886
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:00,880
and you can have a little bit of
 

887
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,230
and you can have a little bit of
reflection on the ground if you want.

888
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:02,240
reflection on the ground if you want.
 

889
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,549
reflection on the ground if you want.
Uh, I'm going to make it easy for my

890
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:04,559
Uh, I'm going to make it easy for my
 

891
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,270
Uh, I'm going to make it easy for my
none uh my non cycles users and just

892
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:07,280
none uh my non cycles users and just
 

893
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,669
none uh my non cycles users and just
keep it in Eevee. And then when you're

894
00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:09,679
keep it in Eevee. And then when you're
 

895
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,270
keep it in Eevee. And then when you're
done, you can just go ahead pick your

896
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:11,280
done, you can just go ahead pick your
 

897
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,710
done, you can just go ahead pick your
resolution. I'm going to keep it at 1920

898
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:12,720
resolution. I'm going to keep it at 1920
 

899
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,789
resolution. I'm going to keep it at 1920

00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:18,480
want Blender to just spit out uh
 

905
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,350
want Blender to just spit out uh
