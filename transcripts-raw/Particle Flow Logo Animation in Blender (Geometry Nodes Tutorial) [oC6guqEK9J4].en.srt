00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:01,280
How's it going, guys? So, in today's
 

3
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,470
How's it going, guys? So, in today's
tutorial, we're going to be creating

4
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:02,480
tutorial, we're going to be creating
 

5
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,309
tutorial, we're going to be creating
this logo animation. We're going to be

6
00:00:04,309 --> 00:00:04,319
this logo animation. We're going to be
 

7
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,070
this logo animation. We're going to be
using Geometry Nodes, and it's really,

8
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:06,080
using Geometry Nodes, and it's really,
 

9
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,670
using Geometry Nodes, and it's really,
really simple to build. First, we're

10
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:07,680
really simple to build. First, we're
 

11
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,270
really simple to build. First, we're
going to take the logo and distribute

12
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:09,280
going to take the logo and distribute
 

13
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,629
going to take the logo and distribute
some points on it. Then, we're going to

14
00:00:10,629 --> 00:00:10,639
some points on it. Then, we're going to
 

15
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:11,910
some points on it. Then, we're going to
take that and make it a little bit more

16
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:11,920
take that and make it a little bit more
 

17
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,230
take that and make it a little bit more
3D and some ZSpace. Then, we can

18
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:14,240
3D and some ZSpace. Then, we can
 

19
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,390
3D and some ZSpace. Then, we can
displace it using a noise texture. After

20
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:16,400
displace it using a noise texture. After
 

21
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,590
displace it using a noise texture. After
that, we're going to distribute some

22
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:17,600
that, we're going to distribute some
 

23
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,670
that, we're going to distribute some
spheres and some flat planes so that we

24
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:19,680
spheres and some flat planes so that we
 

25
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,189
spheres and some flat planes so that we
can get a little bit of glitter and

26
00:00:21,189 --> 00:00:21,199
can get a little bit of glitter and
 

27
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,750
can get a little bit of glitter and
brightness and some color distribution

28
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:23,760
brightness and some color distribution
 

29
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,990
brightness and some color distribution
in this animation. After that, it's just

30
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:26,000
in this animation. After that, it's just
 

31
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,349
in this animation. After that, it's just
going to come down to lighting

32
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:27,359
going to come down to lighting
 

33
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,189
going to come down to lighting
animation, and we're going to be done.

34
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:29,199
animation, and we're going to be done.
 

35
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,710
animation, and we're going to be done.
So, it's really, really simple, but

36
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:30,720
So, it's really, really simple, but
 

37
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,470
So, it's really, really simple, but
super effective and a really, really

38
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:32,480
super effective and a really, really
 

39
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,069
super effective and a really, really
cool animation. If you'd like to get the

being said, let's get into this

72
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:01,760
being said, let's get into this
 

73
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,750
being said, let's get into this
tutorial. All right, so to start out, go

74
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:03,760
tutorial. All right, so to start out, go
 

75
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,350
tutorial. All right, so to start out, go
ahead and grab your logo. If you don't

76
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:05,360
ahead and grab your logo. If you don't
 

77
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,789
ahead and grab your logo. If you don't
have a logo and you just want to follow

78
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:06,799
have a logo and you just want to follow
 

79
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,469
have a logo and you just want to follow
along with this, I would say just take

80
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:08,479
along with this, I would say just take
 

81
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,710
along with this, I would say just take
some text and pick a letter that you

82
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:10,720
some text and pick a letter that you
 

83
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,350
some text and pick a letter that you
like, rightclick, and convert it to a

84
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:13,360
like, rightclick, and convert it to a
 

85
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,750
like, rightclick, and convert it to a
mesh and you will be good to go to

86
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:15,760
mesh and you will be good to go to
 

87
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,510
mesh and you will be good to go to
follow out the rest of this tutorial.

88
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:17,520
follow out the rest of this tutorial.
 

89
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,590
follow out the rest of this tutorial.
Now, if you have a logo in vector

90
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:19,600
Now, if you have a logo in vector
 

91
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,390
Now, if you have a logo in vector
format, what you'll do is go to file,

92
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:22,400
format, what you'll do is go to file,
 

93
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,270
format, what you'll do is go to file,
import, and select SVG. I'm going to go

94
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:25,280
import, and select SVG. I'm going to go
 

95
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,070
import, and select SVG. I'm going to go
ahead and grab my logo in SVG format.

96
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:28,080
ahead and grab my logo in SVG format.
 

97
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,429
ahead and grab my logo in SVG format.
And then I'm going to go ahead and scale

98
00:01:29,429 --> 00:01:29,439
And then I'm going to go ahead and scale
 

99
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,429
And then I'm going to go ahead and scale
it up because they import really small.

100
00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:31,439
it up because they import really small.
 

101
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,870
it up because they import really small.
At least mine does. And then I'm going

102
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:32,880
At least mine does. And then I'm going
 

103
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,950
At least mine does. And then I'm going
to hit tab just to get that anchor point

104
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:34,960
to hit tab just to get that anchor point
 

105
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,230
to hit tab just to get that anchor point
right there in the middle of my logo.

106
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:36,240
right there in the middle of my logo.
 

107
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,069
right there in the middle of my logo.
I'm just using G to move it. And then

108
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:38,079
I'm just using G to move it. And then
 

109
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,670
I'm just using G to move it. And then
very important just cuz it'll kind of

110
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:39,680
very important just cuz it'll kind of
 

111
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,429
very important just cuz it'll kind of
throw off your whole system. Make sure

112
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:41,439
throw off your whole system. Make sure
 

113
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,670
throw off your whole system. Make sure
you hit control A and apply the scale.

114
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:43,680
you hit control A and apply the scale.
 

115
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,789
you hit control A and apply the scale.
That's going to make sure the points

116
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:44,799
That's going to make sure the points
 

117
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,030
That's going to make sure the points
distribute um properly so that this

118
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:47,040
distribute um properly so that this
 

119
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,109
distribute um properly so that this
thing doesn't look like it's tiny. All

120
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:49,119
thing doesn't look like it's tiny. All
 

121
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,630
thing doesn't look like it's tiny. All
right, with that being said, let's go

122
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:50,640
right, with that being said, let's go
 

123
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,910
right, with that being said, let's go
ahead and I'm going to open up a new

124
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:52,920
ahead and I'm going to open up a new
 

125
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,910
ahead and I'm going to open up a new
window. and we are going to switch over

126
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:55,920
window. and we are going to switch over
 

127
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,069
window. and we are going to switch over
this window up here to the geometry

128
00:01:58,069 --> 00:01:58,079
this window up here to the geometry
 

129
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,030
this window up here to the geometry
nodes editor and I'm going to click new.

130
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:01,040
nodes editor and I'm going to click new.
 

131
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,590
nodes editor and I'm going to click new.
So, first thing we want to do is hit

132
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:03,600
So, first thing we want to do is hit
 

133
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,709
So, first thing we want to do is hit
shift A and get a distribute points on

134
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:06,719
shift A and get a distribute points on
 

135
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,630
shift A and get a distribute points on
faces node and then we can just bring

136
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:08,640
faces node and then we can just bring
 

137
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,229
faces node and then we can just bring
out that density. But specifically

138
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:10,239
out that density. But specifically
 

139
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,750
out that density. But specifically
instead of random, go ahead and use

140
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:11,760
instead of random, go ahead and use
 

141
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,510
instead of random, go ahead and use
poison disc. What that's going to do is

142
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:13,520
poison disc. What that's going to do is
 

143
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,270
poison disc. What that's going to do is
give you this distance minimum. I'm

144
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:15,280
give you this distance minimum. I'm
 

145
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,869
give you this distance minimum. I'm
going to bring my density to say I don't

146
00:02:16,869 --> 00:02:16,879
going to bring my density to say I don't
 

147
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,670
going to bring my density to say I don't
know one 1,000. And then you see this

148
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:19,680
know one 1,000. And then you see this
 

149
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,030
know one 1,000. And then you see this
distance minimum that is going to

150
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,040
distance minimum that is going to
 

151
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,510
distance minimum that is going to
prevent them from intersecting. But I

152
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:23,520
prevent them from intersecting. But I
 

153
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,790
prevent them from intersecting. But I
really just want it to be the smallest

154
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:26,800
really just want it to be the smallest
 

155
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,150
really just want it to be the smallest
it can be. Maybe

156
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:29,160
it can be. Maybe
 

157
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,830
it can be. Maybe
point 01 because these objects are going

158
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:31,840
point 01 because these objects are going
 

159
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,589
point 01 because these objects are going
to be really really small. Just having

160
00:02:33,589 --> 00:02:33,599
to be really really small. Just having
 

161
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,589
to be really really small. Just having
the slightest bit of control over their

162
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:35,599
the slightest bit of control over their
 

163
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,470
the slightest bit of control over their
collision will go a long way. So we'll

164
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:38,480
collision will go a long way. So we'll
 

165
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,150
collision will go a long way. So we'll
take this density and now what I want to

166
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:40,160
take this density and now what I want to
 

167
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,309
take this density and now what I want to
do is make it a little bit thicker this

168
00:02:42,309 --> 00:02:42,319
do is make it a little bit thicker this
 

169
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,509
do is make it a little bit thicker this
direction because that's going to just

170
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:43,519
direction because that's going to just
 

171
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,949
direction because that's going to just
make it look better. So we'll get a set

172
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:46,959
make it look better. So we'll get a set
 

173
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,790
make it look better. So we'll get a set
position node. We're going to get

174
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:51,800

 

175
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,030

a combine XYZ node because I just want

176
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:55,040
a combine XYZ node because I just want
 

177
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,350
a combine XYZ node because I just want
to move it on the Z. So that's going to

178
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:57,360
to move it on the Z. So that's going to
 

179
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,430
to move it on the Z. So that's going to
allow us to have access to a Z socket

180
00:02:59,430 --> 00:02:59,440
allow us to have access to a Z socket
 

181
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,750
allow us to have access to a Z socket
and we're going to get a random value

182
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:01,760
and we're going to get a random value
 

183
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,790
and we're going to get a random value
node and plug it right into the Z. And

184
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:04,800
node and plug it right into the Z. And
 

185
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,589
node and plug it right into the Z. And
that's going to go ahead and

186
00:03:07,589 --> 00:03:07,599
that's going to go ahead and
 

187
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,350
that's going to go ahead and
essentially extrude it. So maybe if you

188
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:09,360
essentially extrude it. So maybe if you
 

189
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,270
essentially extrude it. So maybe if you
don't want it all the way there, you can

190
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,280
don't want it all the way there, you can
 

191
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,710
don't want it all the way there, you can
kind of keep it in the middle. But

192
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:12,720
kind of keep it in the middle. But
 

193
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,070
kind of keep it in the middle. But
that's just about as thick as I'd like

194
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,080
that's just about as thick as I'd like
 

195
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,390
that's just about as thick as I'd like
it to be. And so now I'm looking at my

196
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:16,400
it to be. And so now I'm looking at my
 

197
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,589
it to be. And so now I'm looking at my
logo here. So, what we can do now is set

198
00:03:19,589 --> 00:03:19,599
logo here. So, what we can do now is set
 

199
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,949
logo here. So, what we can do now is set
up the noise texture that is going to

200
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:20,959
up the noise texture that is going to
 

201
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,110
up the noise texture that is going to
actually be able to allow us to make all

202
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,120
actually be able to allow us to make all
 

203
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,790
actually be able to allow us to make all
these particles fly out in this really,

204
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:24,800
these particles fly out in this really,
 

205
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,229
these particles fly out in this really,
really interesting way. So, what I'm

206
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:26,239
really interesting way. So, what I'm
 

207
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,990
really interesting way. So, what I'm
going to do is just duplicate this set

208
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:28,000
going to do is just duplicate this set
 

209
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,229
going to do is just duplicate this set
position

210
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:29,239
position
 

211
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:32,390
position
node, get a vector math node, and we're

212
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:32,400
node, get a vector math node, and we're
 

213
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,990
node, get a vector math node, and we're
going to get a noise texture as our

214
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,000
going to get a noise texture as our
 

215
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,830
going to get a noise texture as our
pretty much like our displacement. So,

216
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:37,840
pretty much like our displacement. So,
 

217
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,589
pretty much like our displacement. So,
make sure that you use the color because

218
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:39,599
make sure that you use the color because
 

219
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,670
make sure that you use the color because
if you use factor, it's only going to

220
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:41,680
if you use factor, it's only going to
 

221
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,430
if you use factor, it's only going to
kind of move them what would look like

222
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:43,440
kind of move them what would look like
 

223
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,589
kind of move them what would look like
two axes. It's combining the XYZ into

224
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:45,599
two axes. It's combining the XYZ into
 

225
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,830
two axes. It's combining the XYZ into
sort of this random diagonal. The color

226
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:47,840
sort of this random diagonal. The color
 

227
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,589
sort of this random diagonal. The color
socket gives you multiple colors, which

228
00:03:49,589 --> 00:03:49,599
socket gives you multiple colors, which
 

229
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,830
socket gives you multiple colors, which
gives you X, Y, and Z movement. So,

230
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:51,840
gives you X, Y, and Z movement. So,
 

231
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,190
gives you X, Y, and Z movement. So,
we're going to click on normalize to

232
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:53,200
we're going to click on normalize to
 

233
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,270
we're going to click on normalize to
keep everything in the middle and plug

234
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:55,280
keep everything in the middle and plug
 

235
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,110
keep everything in the middle and plug
color into vector. And you're going to

236
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,120
color into vector. And you're going to
 

237
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,190
color into vector. And you're going to
get this. Now, right now, it's at. We

238
00:03:59,190 --> 00:03:59,200
get this. Now, right now, it's at. We
 

239
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,869
get this. Now, right now, it's at. We
need to switch this over to multiply.

240
00:04:00,869 --> 00:04:00,879
need to switch this over to multiply.
 

241
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,509
need to switch this over to multiply.
What multiply in this case is going to

242
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:03,519
What multiply in this case is going to
 

243
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,670
What multiply in this case is going to
serve as a strength value. So, if you

244
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:05,680
serve as a strength value. So, if you
 

245
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,910
serve as a strength value. So, if you
just click and drag, it's going to

246
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:07,920
just click and drag, it's going to
 

247
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,309
just click and drag, it's going to
adjust the

248
00:04:09,309 --> 00:04:09,319
adjust the
 

249
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:11,670
adjust the
strength of the noise texture. And

250
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:11,680
strength of the noise texture. And
 

251
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,670
strength of the noise texture. And
that's what we're going to use to um

252
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:13,680
that's what we're going to use to um
 

253
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,509
that's what we're going to use to um
that's this one we this is going to be

254
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:15,519
that's this one we this is going to be
 

255
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,349
that's this one we this is going to be
one of our animated values. Now you'll

256
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:17,359
one of our animated values. Now you'll
 

257
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:20,069
one of our animated values. Now you'll
notice these points look huge. And if

258
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:20,079
notice these points look huge. And if
 

259
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,590
notice these points look huge. And if
you're not ready to start instancing

260
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:21,600
you're not ready to start instancing
 

261
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,270
you're not ready to start instancing
objects in here and adding geometry,

262
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:23,280
objects in here and adding geometry,
 

263
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,230
objects in here and adding geometry,
what we're going to do is get

264
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:25,240
what we're going to do is get
 

265
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,310
what we're going to do is get
a set point radius node. And then you

266
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:28,320
a set point radius node. And then you
 

267
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,749
a set point radius node. And then you
can sort of bring them down a little bit

268
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:29,759
can sort of bring them down a little bit
 

269
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,629
can sort of bring them down a little bit
to get a better idea of okay, this is

270
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:32,639
to get a better idea of okay, this is
 

271
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,469
to get a better idea of okay, this is
going to be how it's going to look at

272
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:34,479
going to be how it's going to look at
 

273
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,469
going to be how it's going to look at
the end. So maybe we'll bring up that uh

274
00:04:38,469 --> 00:04:38,479
the end. So maybe we'll bring up that uh
 

275
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,150
the end. So maybe we'll bring up that uh
density max to maybe 5,000. And then you

276
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:42,160
density max to maybe 5,000. And then you
 

277
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,950
density max to maybe 5,000. And then you
can go go back and play with that noise

278
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:44,960
can go go back and play with that noise
 

279
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,950
can go go back and play with that noise
texture. So what I want to do is switch

280
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:46,960
texture. So what I want to do is switch
 

281
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,950
texture. So what I want to do is switch
this noise texture over to 4D because

282
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:48,960
this noise texture over to 4D because
 

283
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,469
this noise texture over to 4D because
this is also going to be another value

284
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:50,479
this is also going to be another value
 

285
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:51,909
this is also going to be another value
that we're going to animate. And I'm

286
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:51,919
that we're going to animate. And I'm
 

287
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,830
that we're going to animate. And I'm
going to bring my scale to one and my

288
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:53,840
going to bring my scale to one and my
 

289
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,950
going to bring my scale to one and my
detail to maybe

290
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:55,960
detail to maybe
 

291
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,790
detail to maybe
five. And you'll see we'll get a really

292
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:00,800
five. And you'll see we'll get a really
 

293
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,430
five. And you'll see we'll get a really
really cool movement. And then the more

294
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:03,440
really cool movement. And then the more
 

295
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,390
really cool movement. And then the more
you bring that scale up, the more

296
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:06,400
you bring that scale up, the more
 

297
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,469
you bring that scale up, the more
interesting or really just more

298
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:08,479
interesting or really just more
 

299
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,749
interesting or really just more
different it's going to look. If you

300
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:09,759
different it's going to look. If you
 

301
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,629
different it's going to look. If you
like sort of a recognizable pattern, you

302
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:12,639
like sort of a recognizable pattern, you
 

303
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,909
like sort of a recognizable pattern, you
can bring that keep that scale around

304
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:13,919
can bring that keep that scale around
 

305
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,749
can bring that keep that scale around
the one, two, or three. Or if you want

306
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:15,759
the one, two, or three. Or if you want
 

307
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,029
the one, two, or three. Or if you want
it to be very just all over the place,

308
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:19,039
it to be very just all over the place,
 

309
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,029
it to be very just all over the place,
you can bring it to a larger value and

310
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:21,039
you can bring it to a larger value and
 

311
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,830
you can bring it to a larger value and
then it kind of looks like a cluster of

312
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:23,840
then it kind of looks like a cluster of
 

313
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,510
then it kind of looks like a cluster of
bugs or whatever coming in. But I tend

314
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:25,520
bugs or whatever coming in. But I tend
 

315
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,070
bugs or whatever coming in. But I tend
to like it to look like kind of a

316
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,080
to like it to look like kind of a
 

317
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,870
to like it to look like kind of a
discernable pattern uh to some degree. I

318
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:30,880
discernable pattern uh to some degree. I
 

319
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,710
discernable pattern uh to some degree. I
really prefer that. All right. Now, what

320
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:32,720
really prefer that. All right. Now, what
 

321
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,710
really prefer that. All right. Now, what
I want to do is instance some objects.

322
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:34,720
I want to do is instance some objects.
 

323
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,270
I want to do is instance some objects.
So, what we need to do is get a separate

324
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:37,280
So, what we need to do is get a separate
 

325
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,189
So, what we need to do is get a separate
geometry node because I want some of the

326
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:39,199
geometry node because I want some of the
 

327
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,950
geometry node because I want some of the
objects to be spheres and other objects

328
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:40,960
objects to be spheres and other objects
 

329
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,670
objects to be spheres and other objects
to be this flat uh these flat circles.

330
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:43,680
to be this flat uh these flat circles.
 

331
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,430
to be this flat uh these flat circles.
So, make sure it stays at the default

332
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:45,440
So, make sure it stays at the default
 

333
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,350
So, make sure it stays at the default
point. And what we're going to do is get

334
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:47,360
point. And what we're going to do is get
 

335
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,110
point. And what we're going to do is get
a instance on points node and we're

336
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,120
a instance on points node and we're
 

337
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,670
a instance on points node and we're
going to get a icosphere here and we'll

338
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:53,680
going to get a icosphere here and we'll
 

339
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,830
going to get a icosphere here and we'll
plug mesh into instance. And then we'll

340
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:55,840
plug mesh into instance. And then we'll
 

341
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,909
plug mesh into instance. And then we'll
bring that radius down. Uh but there's

342
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:57,919
bring that radius down. Uh but there's
 

343
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,510
bring that radius down. Uh but there's
no actual separation happening right

344
00:05:59,510 --> 00:05:59,520
no actual separation happening right
 

345
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,510
no actual separation happening right
now. It's just instancing icospheres on

346
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:01,520
now. It's just instancing icospheres on
 

347
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,629
now. It's just instancing icospheres on
all of the points. We need to get a

348
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:04,639
all of the points. We need to get a
 

349
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,990
all of the points. We need to get a
random value node that is set to boolean

350
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:08,000
random value node that is set to boolean
 

351
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,590
random value node that is set to boolean
so that when we throw it into the

352
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:09,600
so that when we throw it into the
 

353
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,909
so that when we throw it into the
selection, you can actually separate.

354
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:11,919
selection, you can actually separate.
 

355
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,830
selection, you can actually separate.
And so see how there's missing there's

356
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:13,840
And so see how there's missing there's
 

357
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,990
And so see how there's missing there's
missing uh you know, we're deleting

358
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:16,000
missing uh you know, we're deleting
 

359
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,909
missing uh you know, we're deleting
points in a sense. That's cuz we have an

360
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:17,919
points in a sense. That's cuz we have an
 

361
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,070
points in a sense. That's cuz we have an
inverted socket. So all the spots where

362
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,080
inverted socket. So all the spots where
 

363
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,309
inverted socket. So all the spots where
you're seeing objects going away, they

364
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:22,319
you're seeing objects going away, they
 

365
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,510
you're seeing objects going away, they
are now those those spots are being

366
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:25,520
are now those those spots are being
 

367
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,830
are now those those spots are being
occupied by the other the inverted. So,

368
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:27,840
occupied by the other the inverted. So,
 

369
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,710
occupied by the other the inverted. So,
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

370
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:28,720
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
 

371
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,550
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
duplicate this instance on points. Plug

372
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:30,560
duplicate this instance on points. Plug
 

373
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,749
duplicate this instance on points. Plug
inverted into that. And we'll get a join

374
00:06:33,749 --> 00:06:33,759
inverted into that. And we'll get a join
 

375
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,749
inverted into that. And we'll get a join
geometry node and plug instances into

376
00:06:36,749 --> 00:06:36,759
geometry node and plug instances into
 

377
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:39,830
geometry node and plug instances into
geometry. And then we're going to get a

378
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:39,840
geometry. And then we're going to get a
 

379
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,950
geometry. And then we're going to get a
mesh circle and plug mesh into instance.

380
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:42,960
mesh circle and plug mesh into instance.
 

381
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,230
mesh circle and plug mesh into instance.
And they're going to be huge. First off,

382
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:44,240
And they're going to be huge. First off,
 

383
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,550
And they're going to be huge. First off,
we need to switch this over to inggon.

384
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:46,560
we need to switch this over to inggon.
 

385
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,469
we need to switch this over to inggon.
And then bring that radius in. I'm going

386
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:48,479
And then bring that radius in. I'm going
 

387
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,110
And then bring that radius in. I'm going
to give them vertices of six and then

388
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,120
to give them vertices of six and then
 

389
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,990
to give them vertices of six and then
bring that in again. And so now we have

390
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,000
bring that in again. And so now we have
 

391
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,550
bring that in again. And so now we have
a random distribution of each. What I

392
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:56,560
a random distribution of each. What I
 

393
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,749
a random distribution of each. What I
want is more uh spheres than I have

394
00:06:59,749 --> 00:06:59,759
want is more uh spheres than I have
 

395
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,430
want is more uh spheres than I have
essentially these these they're they're

396
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:01,440
essentially these these they're they're
 

397
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,550
essentially these these they're they're
going to look like glitter in the

398
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:02,560
going to look like glitter in the
 

399
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,150
going to look like glitter in the
render. So, we're just going to keep

400
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,160
render. So, we're just going to keep
 

401
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,270
render. So, we're just going to keep
them at that. Right here in the

402
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,280
them at that. Right here in the
 

403
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,230
them at that. Right here in the
icosphere, I'm going to give it a

404
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:06,240
icosphere, I'm going to give it a
 

405
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,670
icosphere, I'm going to give it a
subdivision of one just to keep

406
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:07,680
subdivision of one just to keep
 

407
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,870
subdivision of one just to keep
everything smooth. And we'll get

408
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:09,880
everything smooth. And we'll get
 

409
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,670
everything smooth. And we'll get
a set shade smooth node. And then I'm

410
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:13,680
a set shade smooth node. And then I'm
 

411
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,909
a set shade smooth node. And then I'm
going to

412
00:07:14,909 --> 00:07:14,919
going to
 

413
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:18,189
going to
get another random value

414
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:18,199
get another random value
 

415
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:21,830
get another random value
node and plug it into the scale of our

416
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:21,840
node and plug it into the scale of our
 

417
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,909
node and plug it into the scale of our
uh spheres. Looks like it's randomizing.

418
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:23,919
uh spheres. Looks like it's randomizing.
 

419
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,749
uh spheres. Looks like it's randomizing.
Yep. Okay. So, we have the We'll bring

420
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:25,759
Yep. Okay. So, we have the We'll bring
 

421
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,749
Yep. Okay. So, we have the We'll bring
these down. Bring these up a little bit.

422
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:27,759
these down. Bring these up a little bit.
 

423
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,029
these down. Bring these up a little bit.
I do want randomness in the scale of our

424
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:31,039
I do want randomness in the scale of our
 

425
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,469
I do want randomness in the scale of our
spheres. So, something

426
00:07:33,469 --> 00:07:33,479
spheres. So, something
 

427
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:36,790
spheres. So, something
like that. And then we'll get another

428
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:36,800
like that. And then we'll get another
 

429
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,870
like that. And then we'll get another
random value node. And we need to plug

430
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:38,880
random value node. And we need to plug
 

431
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,670
random value node. And we need to plug
it into the rotation of the uh flat

432
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:42,680
it into the rotation of the uh flat
 

433
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,870
it into the rotation of the uh flat
spheres. And then we'll just randomize

434
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:44,880
spheres. And then we'll just randomize
 

435
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,510
spheres. And then we'll just randomize
it like that. And that is going to help

436
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:47,520
it like that. And that is going to help
 

437
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,070
it like that. And that is going to help
when the light hits them, they will uh

438
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,080
when the light hits them, they will uh
 

439
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,670
when the light hits them, they will uh
reflect really nicely. And then I do

440
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:51,680
reflect really nicely. And then I do
 

441
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,790
reflect really nicely. And then I do
want them to be a little bit smaller. I

442
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:54,800
want them to be a little bit smaller. I
 

443
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,990
want them to be a little bit smaller. I
want them to be kind of a subtle

444
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:56,000
want them to be kind of a subtle
 

445
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,309
want them to be kind of a subtle
glitter. And then now that we're here, I

446
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:00,319
glitter. And then now that we're here, I
 

447
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,070
glitter. And then now that we're here, I
still think the spheres are too big, but

448
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:02,080
still think the spheres are too big, but
 

449
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,189
still think the spheres are too big, but
I'm going to go ahead and bring up the

450
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:03,199
I'm going to go ahead and bring up the
 

451
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,230
I'm going to go ahead and bring up the
density

452
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:05,240
density
 

453
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,150
density
to 20,000. And then I'm going to go back

454
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:08,160
to 20,000. And then I'm going to go back
 

455
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,749
to 20,000. And then I'm going to go back
to my random value that's controlling

456
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:09,759
to my random value that's controlling
 

457
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,230
to my random value that's controlling
the spheres. And just bring them

458
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:12,240
the spheres. And just bring them
 

459
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,029
the spheres. And just bring them
smaller. Bring a couple bigger. And then

460
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:15,039
smaller. Bring a couple bigger. And then
 

461
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,270
smaller. Bring a couple bigger. And then
I think that's good. That's good for

462
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:17,280
I think that's good. That's good for
 

463
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,869
I think that's good. That's good for
now. we can go ahead and um add color

464
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:20,879
now. we can go ahead and um add color
 

465
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,469
now. we can go ahead and um add color
into the scene. So, I'm going to go here

466
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:22,479
into the scene. So, I'm going to go here
 

467
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,230
into the scene. So, I'm going to go here
to the material preview and we're going

468
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:24,240
to the material preview and we're going
 

469
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,990
to the material preview and we're going
to get two materials here in geometry

470
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,000
to get two materials here in geometry
 

471
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,309
to get two materials here in geometry
nodes. We're going to get a set material

472
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:28,319
nodes. We're going to get a set material
 

473
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,389
nodes. We're going to get a set material
node and just duplicate it. So, this see

474
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:32,399
node and just duplicate it. So, this see
 

475
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,750
node and just duplicate it. So, this see
where it says mesh circle. See that

476
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:33,760
where it says mesh circle. See that
 

477
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,509
where it says mesh circle. See that
line? So, this bottom one here that is

478
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:35,519
line? So, this bottom one here that is
 

479
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,589
line? So, this bottom one here that is
going to represent the metal or the

480
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:37,599
going to represent the metal or the
 

481
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,190
going to represent the metal or the
metallic gold material that we're going

482
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:39,200
metallic gold material that we're going
 

483
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,389
metallic gold material that we're going
to make and the other one is going to be

484
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:40,399
to make and the other one is going to be
 

485
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,230
to make and the other one is going to be
that nice red. So, let's select this

486
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:42,240
that nice red. So, let's select this
 

487
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,509
that nice red. So, let's select this
one. Make it kind of a interesting red.

488
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:45,519
one. Make it kind of a interesting red.
 

489
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,710
one. Make it kind of a interesting red.
You can really obviously do any color

490
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:48,720
You can really obviously do any color
 

491
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,990
You can really obviously do any color
you want. I'm gonna bring my roughness

492
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,000
you want. I'm gonna bring my roughness
 

493
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,750
you want. I'm gonna bring my roughness
all the way up. And then I'm going to

494
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:51,760
all the way up. And then I'm going to
 

495
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,630
all the way up. And then I'm going to
select it there. And then here on this

496
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:54,640
select it there. And then here on this
 

497
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,590
select it there. And then here on this
material, we're going to make it

498
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:55,600
material, we're going to make it
 

499
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,030
material, we're going to make it
metallic, pretty rough. And then a gold

500
00:08:59,030 --> 00:08:59,040
metallic, pretty rough. And then a gold
 

501
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,990
metallic, pretty rough. And then a gold
color. And then grab it there. And so

502
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:02,000
color. And then grab it there. And so
 

503
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,310
color. And then grab it there. And so
now we

504
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:03,320
now we
 

505
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,550
now we
have all of that. So now we can go into

506
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:06,560
have all of that. So now we can go into
 

507
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,430
have all of that. So now we can go into
the lighting of this scene. So I'm just

508
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:09,440
the lighting of this scene. So I'm just
 

509
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,990
the lighting of this scene. So I'm just
going to bring this

510
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:11,000
going to bring this
 

511
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,350
going to bring this
uh I'm going to bring this geometry

512
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:13,360
uh I'm going to bring this geometry
 

513
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,190
uh I'm going to bring this geometry
window over a little bit.

514
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:15,200
window over a little bit.
 

515
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,550
window over a little bit.
And I'm going to go ahead and get a

516
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:16,560
And I'm going to go ahead and get a
 

517
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,949
And I'm going to go ahead and get a
camera. So, shift A, get a camera. I'm

518
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:18,959
camera. So, shift A, get a camera. I'm
 

519
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,190
camera. So, shift A, get a camera. I'm
going hit G and middle click. And then

520
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:21,200
going hit G and middle click. And then
 

521
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,949
going hit G and middle click. And then
just position it. We're going to right

522
00:09:22,949 --> 00:09:22,959
just position it. We're going to right
 

523
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,509
just position it. We're going to right
over here in the camera settings. Give

524
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:25,519
over here in the camera settings. Give
 

525
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,829
over here in the camera settings. Give
it 24 mm. G and middle click

526
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:28,839
it 24 mm. G and middle click
 

527
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:31,030
it 24 mm. G and middle click
again. Something like that. And this

528
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:31,040
again. Something like that. And this
 

529
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,389
again. Something like that. And this
right here, my immediate thought is,

530
00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:33,399
right here, my immediate thought is,
 

531
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:37,630
right here, my immediate thought is,
okay, the density needs to be higher on

532
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:37,640
okay, the density needs to be higher on
 

533
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,550
okay, the density needs to be higher on
um the density needs to be higher on how

534
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:40,560
um the density needs to be higher on how
 

535
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,550
um the density needs to be higher on how
many objects are in this scene. So, what

536
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:42,560
many objects are in this scene. So, what
 

537
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,389
many objects are in this scene. So, what
I'm going to do is right here on the

538
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:44,399
I'm going to do is right here on the
 

539
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,190
I'm going to do is right here on the
distance minimum, maybe

540
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:48,200

 

541
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,030

0.00 5 ought to give us a good amount of

542
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,040
0.00 5 ought to give us a good amount of
 

543
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,870
0.00 5 ought to give us a good amount of
density. So, that looks really, really

544
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:52,880
density. So, that looks really, really
 

545
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,470
density. So, that looks really, really
nice. So, now we can go ahead. I'm going

546
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:54,480
nice. So, now we can go ahead. I'm going
 

547
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,310
nice. So, now we can go ahead. I'm going
to bring this window back and we can go

548
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:56,320
to bring this window back and we can go
 

549
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,990
to bring this window back and we can go
into lighting. So, I'm going to go here

550
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,000
into lighting. So, I'm going to go here
 

551
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,150
into lighting. So, I'm going to go here
to the cycles view. I am using cycles

552
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:00,160
to the cycles view. I am using cycles
 

553
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,550
to the cycles view. I am using cycles
for this. I'm going to be dnoising my

554
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:02,560
for this. I'm going to be dnoising my
 

555
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,470
for this. I'm going to be dnoising my
scene and I'm going to be using 300 on

556
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:04,480
scene and I'm going to be using 300 on
 

557
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,790
scene and I'm going to be using 300 on
the samples. So, here in the world,

558
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:06,800
the samples. So, here in the world,
 

559
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,350
the samples. So, here in the world,
we'll bring it down to black.

560
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:09,360
we'll bring it down to black.
 

561
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,550
we'll bring it down to black.
I'm going to go ahead and get in a area

562
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:13,560
I'm going to go ahead and get in a area
 

563
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,710
I'm going to go ahead and get in a area
light. Hit G and we're going to do a

564
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:16,720
light. Hit G and we're going to do a
 

565
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,470
light. Hit G and we're going to do a
single lighting setup. This is something

566
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:18,480
single lighting setup. This is something
 

567
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,630
single lighting setup. This is something
I do really really often and honestly is

568
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:22,640
I do really really often and honestly is
 

569
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,550
I do really really often and honestly is
useful in so many cases. So, we're going

570
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:24,560
useful in so many cases. So, we're going
 

571
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,710
useful in so many cases. So, we're going
to use a disc shape. Going to make it

572
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:26,720
to use a disc shape. Going to make it
 

573
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,470
to use a disc shape. Going to make it
nice and big. And then we're going to go

574
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:28,480
nice and big. And then we're going to go
 

575
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,829
nice and big. And then we're going to go
here to the cycles preview and maybe

576
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:29,839
here to the cycles preview and maybe
 

577
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,310
here to the cycles preview and maybe
bring my power of

578
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:31,320
bring my power of
 

579
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,949
bring my power of
like 2,00 here in the world. We'll go

580
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:34,959
like 2,00 here in the world. We'll go
 

581
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,949
like 2,00 here in the world. We'll go
here to the volume and add a principled

582
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:36,959
here to the volume and add a principled
 

583
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,990
here to the volume and add a principled
volume node. And then 01 is going to

584
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:40,000
volume node. And then 01 is going to
 

585
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,150
volume node. And then 01 is going to
give us a nice volume. And then back to

586
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:42,160
give us a nice volume. And then back to
 

587
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,509
give us a nice volume. And then back to
the camera settings, we can bring that

588
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:43,519
the camera settings, we can bring that
 

589
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,030
the camera settings, we can bring that
spread down till we have a little bit of

590
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,040
spread down till we have a little bit of
 

591
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,630
spread down till we have a little bit of
black here. And then I'm just going to

592
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:48,640
black here. And then I'm just going to
 

593
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,470
black here. And then I'm just going to
go ahead and get a render

594
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:51,480
go ahead and get a render
 

595
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,990
go ahead and get a render
region. So looks like 2,000 is too

596
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:54,000
region. So looks like 2,000 is too
 

597
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,590
region. So looks like 2,000 is too
bright. Let's go with like 500 for now.

598
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:57,600
bright. Let's go with like 500 for now.
 

599
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,670
bright. Let's go with like 500 for now.
So here we go. We have this scene and it

600
00:10:59,670 --> 00:10:59,680
So here we go. We have this scene and it
 

601
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,350
So here we go. We have this scene and it
looks really nice right now. I'm going

602
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:01,360
looks really nice right now. I'm going
 

603
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,150
looks really nice right now. I'm going
to click on this and go to the red here.

604
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:04,160
to click on this and go to the red here.
 

605
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,269
to click on this and go to the red here.
And I'm just going to go ahead and hover

606
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:05,279
And I'm just going to go ahead and hover
 

607
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,670
And I'm just going to go ahead and hover
over it. Hit Ctrl + C. Go to the camera.

608
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:07,680
over it. Hit Ctrl + C. Go to the camera.
 

609
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,150
over it. Hit Ctrl + C. Go to the camera.
I'm going to hit Ctrl +V. And then I'm

610
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,160
I'm going to hit Ctrl +V. And then I'm
 

611
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,870
I'm going to hit Ctrl +V. And then I'm
just going to bring the saturation down

612
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:12,880
just going to bring the saturation down
 

613
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,230
just going to bring the saturation down
so that we get this

614
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:15,240
so that we get this
 

615
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,430
so that we get this
uniformity I think is the right word.

616
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:17,440
uniformity I think is the right word.
 

617
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,389
uniformity I think is the right word.
Uniformity in the color. So now that

618
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:20,399
Uniformity in the color. So now that
 

619
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,269
Uniformity in the color. So now that
we're here, what I want to do is at

620
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:23,279
we're here, what I want to do is at
 

621
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,790
we're here, what I want to do is at
certain points in the scene, see how

622
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:24,800
certain points in the scene, see how
 

623
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,710
certain points in the scene, see how
this piece of metal is really bright?

624
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:26,720
this piece of metal is really bright?
 

625
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,990
this piece of metal is really bright?
It's really bright. It's reflecting.

626
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,000
It's really bright. It's reflecting.
 

627
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,350
It's really bright. It's reflecting.
It's directly reflecting that light.

628
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:29,360
It's directly reflecting that light.
 

629
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,430
It's directly reflecting that light.
It's going to be very very bright, but

630
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:31,440
It's going to be very very bright, but
 

631
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,350
It's going to be very very bright, but
it's hard to communicate how bright that

632
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:33,360
it's hard to communicate how bright that
 

633
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,590
it's hard to communicate how bright that
is if we don't have any compositing. So,

634
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:35,600
is if we don't have any compositing. So,
 

635
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,470
is if we don't have any compositing. So,
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

636
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:36,480
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
 

637
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,870
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
render out one frame and add some glare

638
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:38,880
render out one frame and add some glare
 

639
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,790
render out one frame and add some glare
in the compositor. All right, so we have

640
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:40,800
in the compositor. All right, so we have
 

641
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,310
in the compositor. All right, so we have
a frame rendered out. I'm going to go

642
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:42,320
a frame rendered out. I'm going to go
 

643
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,509
a frame rendered out. I'm going to go
here to the compositing. I'm going to

644
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:43,519
here to the compositing. I'm going to
 

645
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,829
here to the compositing. I'm going to
click use nodes. I'm going to go ahead

646
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:45,839
click use nodes. I'm going to go ahead
 

647
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,470
click use nodes. I'm going to go ahead
and get a viewer node. And then I'm

648
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:48,480
and get a viewer node. And then I'm
 

649
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,949
and get a viewer node. And then I'm
going to hit shift and uh rightclick.

650
00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:50,959
going to hit shift and uh rightclick.
 

651
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,870
going to hit shift and uh rightclick.
And there we're going to get a glare

652
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:52,880
And there we're going to get a glare
 

653
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,710
And there we're going to get a glare
node. Plug it there. And then we're

654
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:54,720
node. Plug it there. And then we're
 

655
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,110
node. Plug it there. And then we're
going to go here to

656
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:56,120
going to go here to
 

657
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,509
going to go here to
uh to bloom. And then we're just going

658
00:11:59,509 --> 00:11:59,519
uh to bloom. And then we're just going
 

659
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,269
uh to bloom. And then we're just going
to go ahead and on the highlights I'm

660
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:01,279
to go ahead and on the highlights I'm
 

661
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,389
to go ahead and on the highlights I'm
going to bring that threshold up just a

662
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:04,399
going to bring that threshold up just a
 

663
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,389
going to bring that threshold up just a
little bit so that we can just kind of

664
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:06,399
little bit so that we can just kind of
 

665
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,350
little bit so that we can just kind of
highlight those those points there. And

666
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:09,360
highlight those those points there. And
 

667
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,790
highlight those those points there. And
then we can go back. I'm going to say

668
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:10,800
then we can go back. I'm going to say
 

669
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,949
then we can go back. I'm going to say
click maybe and then you can hit this

670
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:12,959
click maybe and then you can hit this
 

671
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,710
click maybe and then you can hit this
drop down and click always and you'll

672
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:14,720
drop down and click always and you'll
 

673
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,670
drop down and click always and you'll
get to see those points. So now I'm

674
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:17,680
get to see those points. So now I'm
 

675
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,910
get to see those points. So now I'm
going to go and animate this. So bring

676
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:19,920
going to go and animate this. So bring
 

677
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,910
going to go and animate this. So bring
we're going to bring our window

678
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:22,920
we're going to bring our window
 

679
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,710
we're going to bring our window
back and then in the in your preferences

680
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:26,720
back and then in the in your preferences
 

681
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,389
back and then in the in your preferences
right here where it says linear. So go

682
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:28,399
right here where it says linear. So go
 

683
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,190
right here where it says linear. So go
to the animation preferences. Go here.

684
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:31,200
to the animation preferences. Go here.
 

685
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,509
to the animation preferences. Go here.
Switch it over to

686
00:12:32,509 --> 00:12:32,519
Switch it over to
 

687
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,550
Switch it over to
bezier. And we're going to animate this.

688
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:34,560
bezier. And we're going to animate this.
 

689
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,310
bezier. And we're going to animate this.
So go to your vector math node. I'm

690
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:36,320
So go to your vector math node. I'm
 

691
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,870
So go to your vector math node. I'm
going to go ahead and bring it out to

692
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:38,880
going to go ahead and bring it out to
 

693
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,190
going to go ahead and bring it out to
something like that. I'm going to hit I.

694
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:41,200
something like that. I'm going to hit I.
 

695
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,750
something like that. I'm going to hit I.
Go to frame

696
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:42,760
Go to frame
 

697
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,990
Go to frame
200. And then type in zero and hit I

698
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:46,000
200. And then type in zero and hit I
 

699
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,069
200. And then type in zero and hit I
again. So this is the animation we have

700
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:50,079
again. So this is the animation we have
 

701
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,389
again. So this is the animation we have
so far. We'll just view it one more

702
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:52,399
so far. We'll just view it one more
 

703
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,389
so far. We'll just view it one more
time. Now, there's another piece of this

704
00:12:55,389 --> 00:12:55,399
time. Now, there's another piece of this
 

705
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:58,310
time. Now, there's another piece of this
animation that uh we can add some

706
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:58,320
animation that uh we can add some
 

707
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,750
animation that uh we can add some
movement into it to make it look a

708
00:12:59,750 --> 00:12:59,760
movement into it to make it look a
 

709
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,590
movement into it to make it look a
little bit more alive and more organic.

710
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:01,600
little bit more alive and more organic.
 

711
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,389
little bit more alive and more organic.
And that is going to be this W value.

712
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:04,399
And that is going to be this W value.
 

713
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,310
And that is going to be this W value.
But it's really really sensitive. So,

714
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:06,320
But it's really really sensitive. So,
 

715
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,670
But it's really really sensitive. So,
make sure we just do a little bit. So,

716
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:07,680
make sure we just do a little bit. So,
 

717
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,910
make sure we just do a little bit. So,
I'm going to hit I'm going to go back to

718
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:09,920
I'm going to hit I'm going to go back to
 

719
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,350
I'm going to hit I'm going to go back to
my preferences and switch this back to

720
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:12,360
my preferences and switch this back to
 

721
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,829
my preferences and switch this back to
linear. I'm going to hit I on the W, go

722
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:15,839
linear. I'm going to hit I on the W, go
 

723
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,470
linear. I'm going to hit I on the W, go
to 200, and I'm just going to move it a

724
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:18,480
to 200, and I'm just going to move it a
 

725
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:24,069
to 200, and I'm just going to move it a
tad bit to like 03 maybe.

726
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:24,079
tad bit to like 03 maybe.
 

727
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,069
tad bit to like 03 maybe.
And that is just going to randomly move

728
00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:26,079
And that is just going to randomly move
 

729
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,629
And that is just going to randomly move
these objects around. Even 03 is too

730
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:28,639
these objects around. Even 03 is too
 

731
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:33,230
these objects around. Even 03 is too
much. Maybe

732
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:33,240

 

733
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,629

01. No, that was needs to be 0.1, not

734
00:13:37,629 --> 00:13:37,639
01. No, that was needs to be 0.1, not
 

735
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:42,310
01. No, that was needs to be 0.1, not
01. 0.1. There we go. There we go. So,

736
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:42,320
01. 0.1. There we go. There we go. So,
 

737
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,790
01. 0.1. There we go. There we go. So,
now they're just moving around at a more

738
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:44,800
now they're just moving around at a more
 

739
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,190
now they're just moving around at a more
reasonable

740
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:48,200

 

741
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,670

speed. Nice. All right. So now I just

742
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:51,680
speed. Nice. All right. So now I just
 

743
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,150
speed. Nice. All right. So now I just
want to

744
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:53,160
want to
 

745
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,870
want to
view the

746
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:55,880
view the
 

747
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,910
view the
compositing. See these little glare

748
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:57,920
compositing. See these little glare
 

749
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,310
compositing. See these little glare
moments. So now we have these little

750
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:00,320
moments. So now we have these little
 

751
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,550
moments. So now we have these little
really nice little highlight moments

752
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:02,560
really nice little highlight moments
 

753
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,629
really nice little highlight moments
here in the scene. That's just going to

754
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:04,639
here in the scene. That's just going to
 

755
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:05,590
here in the scene. That's just going to
make it look a little bit more

756
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:05,600
make it look a little bit more
 

757
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,110
make it look a little bit more
beautiful. And then maybe even see the

758
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:09,120
beautiful. And then maybe even see the
 

759
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,430
beautiful. And then maybe even see the
random value that's connected to the

760
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:11,440
random value that's connected to the
 

761
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,110
random value that's connected to the
separated geometry. Just bring that

762
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:14,120
separated geometry. Just bring that
 

763
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,670
separated geometry. Just bring that
back. Maybe a few more pieces of

764
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:16,680
back. Maybe a few more pieces of
 

765
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,030
back. Maybe a few more pieces of
glitter. There we go. That's going to be

766
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,040
glitter. There we go. That's going to be
 

767
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,750
glitter. There we go. That's going to be
awesome. Okay, we are done with this

768
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:21,760
awesome. Okay, we are done with this
 

769
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,030
awesome. Okay, we are done with this
animation. So, I'm just going to close

770
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,040
animation. So, I'm just going to close
 

771
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,829
animation. So, I'm just going to close
the geometry nodes window. We can double

772
00:14:25,829 --> 00:14:25,839
the geometry nodes window. We can double
 

773
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:33,870
the geometry nodes window. We can double
check this animation looks

774

799
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,829
export a a video for you, you don't want
to deal with PNG sequences, you can go

800
00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:03,839
to deal with PNG sequences, you can go
 

801
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:09,550
to deal with PNG sequences, you can go
ahead to FFmpeg video um encoding

802
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:09,560
ahead to FFmpeg video um encoding
 

803
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,629
ahead to FFmpeg video um encoding
to MP4. And then you'll hit render

804
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:12,639
to MP4. And then you'll hit render
 

805
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,550
to MP4. And then you'll hit render
render animation. And when you're done,

806
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:14,560
render animation. And when you're done,
 

807
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,910
render animation. And when you're done,
you'll have a really, really cool
