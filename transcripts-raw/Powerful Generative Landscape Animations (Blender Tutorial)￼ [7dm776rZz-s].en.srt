00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,510

How's it going, guys? So, in this

2
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:01,520
How's it going, guys? So, in this
 

3
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,270
How's it going, guys? So, in this
tutorial, we are going to be creating

4
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:03,280
tutorial, we are going to be creating
 

5
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,030
tutorial, we are going to be creating
this animation right here. It's going to

6
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:05,040
this animation right here. It's going to
 

7
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,349
this animation right here. It's going to
be super fun and pretty easy. First

8
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:07,359
be super fun and pretty easy. First
 

9
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:08,790
be super fun and pretty easy. First
thing we're going to do is hop into

10
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:08,800
thing we're going to do is hop into
 

11
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,549
thing we're going to do is hop into
geometry nodes and create some

12
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:10,559
geometry nodes and create some
 

13
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,870
geometry nodes and create some
displacement and shape it to look more

14
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:12,880
displacement and shape it to look more
 

15
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,870
displacement and shape it to look more
like hills. After that, I'll show you

16
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:14,880
like hills. After that, I'll show you
 

17
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,189
like hills. After that, I'll show you
how to mirror displacement in geometry

18
00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:17,199
how to mirror displacement in geometry
 

19
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,630
how to mirror displacement in geometry
nodes. And that's going to allow us to

20
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:18,640
nodes. And that's going to allow us to
 

21
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,550
nodes. And that's going to allow us to
create our camera and make a looping

22
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:20,560
create our camera and make a looping
 

23
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,710
create our camera and make a looping
animation with the displacement. Then,

24
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:22,720
animation with the displacement. Then,
 

25
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,070
animation with the displacement. Then,
we're going to hop into the shading, and

26
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:24,080
we're going to hop into the shading, and
 

27
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,509
we're going to hop into the shading, and
I'm going to show you a simple way to

28
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:25,519
I'm going to show you a simple way to
 

29
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,670
I'm going to show you a simple way to
make a really nice stepped gradient

30
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:27,680
make a really nice stepped gradient
 

31
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,429
make a really nice stepped gradient
effect. Then we're going to combine two

32
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:29,439
effect. Then we're going to combine two
 

33
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:30,950
effect. Then we're going to combine two
different wave textures to create a

34
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:30,960
different wave textures to create a
 

35
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,270
different wave textures to create a
really nice animated line effect. We're

36
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:33,280
really nice animated line effect. We're
 

37
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,030
really nice animated line effect. We're
going to solidify that topographic map

38
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:35,040
going to solidify that topographic map
 

39
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,950
going to solidify that topographic map
inspiration and create a grid floor for

40
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:36,960
inspiration and create a grid floor for
 

41
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,950
inspiration and create a grid floor for
the bottom and we'll be done. This

42
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:38,960
the bottom and we'll be done. This
 

43
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,549
the bottom and we'll be done. This
animation is part of a series of

that being said, let's get into this

96
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:28,000
that being said, let's get into this
 

97
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,630
that being said, let's get into this
tutorial. All right, so we are going to

98
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:30,640
tutorial. All right, so we are going to
 

99
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,550
tutorial. All right, so we are going to
go ahead and I'm going to hop into the

100
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:32,560
go ahead and I'm going to hop into the
 

101
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,429
go ahead and I'm going to hop into the
Geometry Notes workspace and just delete

102
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:35,439
Geometry Notes workspace and just delete
 

103
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,270
Geometry Notes workspace and just delete
these windows. Just get it how I like

104
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:37,280
these windows. Just get it how I like
 

105
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,670
these windows. Just get it how I like
it. Let's get a plane. Let's call it

106
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:41,680
it. Let's get a plane. Let's call it
 

107
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,789
it. Let's get a plane. Let's call it
just going to call it geo. We're going

108
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:42,799
just going to call it geo. We're going
 

109
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,749
just going to call it geo. We're going
to build the displacement and the tiling

110
00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:45,759
to build the displacement and the tiling
 

111
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,830
to build the displacement and the tiling
uh directly in geometry nodes. So, it

112
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:47,840
uh directly in geometry nodes. So, it
 

113
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,870
uh directly in geometry nodes. So, it
should be really fun. So, we're going to

114
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:48,880
should be really fun. So, we're going to
 

115
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,190
should be really fun. So, we're going to
click new. Let's go ahead and delete

116
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:51,200
click new. Let's go ahead and delete
 

117
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,670
click new. Let's go ahead and delete
this. We're going to go ahead and get a

118
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:53,680
this. We're going to go ahead and get a
 

119
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,830
this. We're going to go ahead and get a
get a grid. And then we're going to plug

120
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:55,840
get a grid. And then we're going to plug
 

121
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,830
get a grid. And then we're going to plug
this right into here. And we're going to

122
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:57,840
this right into here. And we're going to
 

123
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,789
this right into here. And we're going to
make it 40x 40. Really big. Uh really

124
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:02,799
make it 40x 40. Really big. Uh really
 

125
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,350
make it 40x 40. Really big. Uh really
it's like 20 by 20. Then we can make the

126
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:05,360
it's like 20 by 20. Then we can make the
 

127
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,029
it's like 20 by 20. Then we can make the
vertices at about

128
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:09,039
vertices at about
 

129
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,150
vertices at about
300 by 300. And that's going to give us

130
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:12,160
300 by 300. And that's going to give us
 

131
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,030
300 by 300. And that's going to give us
a nice amount of subdivision for nice

132
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,040
a nice amount of subdivision for nice
 

133
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,869
a nice amount of subdivision for nice
smooth displacement. So, speaking of

134
00:02:16,869 --> 00:02:16,879
smooth displacement. So, speaking of
 

135
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,589
smooth displacement. So, speaking of
displacement, we're going to get a set

136
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:19,599
displacement, we're going to get a set
 

137
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,550
displacement, we're going to get a set
position node. Let's get a

138
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:24,560
position node. Let's get a
 

139
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,190
position node. Let's get a
going to get a combined XYZ node. And

140
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:27,200
going to get a combined XYZ node. And
 

141
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,750
going to get a combined XYZ node. And
we're going to plug a noise texture

142
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:29,760
we're going to plug a noise texture
 

143
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,790
we're going to plug a noise texture
right into the Z. So, let's plug factor.

144
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:32,800
right into the Z. So, let's plug factor.
 

145
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,309
right into the Z. So, let's plug factor.
Let's put color. We're going to switch

146
00:02:34,309 --> 00:02:34,319
Let's put color. We're going to switch
 

147
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,550
Let's put color. We're going to switch
to heterotrain and bring that scale up

148
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:38,560
to heterotrain and bring that scale up
 

149
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,550
to heterotrain and bring that scale up
pretty nicely. And then let's get a

150
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:40,560
pretty nicely. And then let's get a
 

151
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,550
pretty nicely. And then let's get a
vector math node.

152
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:42,560
vector math node.
 

153
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,470
vector math node.
This vector math node is going to allow

154
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:44,480
This vector math node is going to allow
 

155
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,390
This vector math node is going to allow
us to adjust the strength of the

156
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:46,400
us to adjust the strength of the
 

157
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,670
us to adjust the strength of the
displacement. So, if we bring it all the

158
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:47,680
displacement. So, if we bring it all the
 

159
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,869
displacement. So, if we bring it all the
way down here to scale, we can do

160
00:02:50,869 --> 00:02:50,879
way down here to scale, we can do
 

161
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,229
way down here to scale, we can do
something like this. Now, I need some

162
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:54,239
something like this. Now, I need some
 

163
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,350
something like this. Now, I need some
flat portions to give it that that uh

164
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:57,360
flat portions to give it that that uh
 

165
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,990
flat portions to give it that that uh
topographic map uh look. So, the way

166
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,000
topographic map uh look. So, the way
 

167
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,149
topographic map uh look. So, the way
we're going to do that is with a RGB

168
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:02,159
we're going to do that is with a RGB
 

169
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,990
we're going to do that is with a RGB
curves node. So, get an RGB curves node.

170
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:06,000
curves node. So, get an RGB curves node.
 

171
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,670
curves node. So, get an RGB curves node.
We're going to zoom in here. We're going

172
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:07,680
We're going to zoom in here. We're going
 

173
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,149
We're going to zoom in here. We're going
to add just a point right about here and

174
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:10,159
to add just a point right about here and
 

175
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,110
to add just a point right about here and
a point here and a point here. And then

176
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:13,120
a point here and a point here. And then
 

177
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,550
a point here and a point here. And then
bring this up. And that's going to

178
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:14,560
bring this up. And that's going to
 

179
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,430
bring this up. And that's going to
flatten it uh pretty dramatically. So we

180
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:17,440
flatten it uh pretty dramatically. So we
 

181
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,550
flatten it uh pretty dramatically. So we
can bring this down like that

182
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:20,560
can bring this down like that
 

183
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,949
can bring this down like that
until we have some flat portions. But it

184
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:22,959
until we have some flat portions. But it
 

185
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,030
until we have some flat portions. But it
doesn't need to be super super flat.

186
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,040
doesn't need to be super super flat.
 

187
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,270
doesn't need to be super super flat.
What I don't want is things jutting down

188
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:27,280
What I don't want is things jutting down
 

189
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,149
What I don't want is things jutting down
too far cuz if we do this, see that? So

190
00:03:30,149 --> 00:03:30,159
too far cuz if we do this, see that? So
 

191
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,350
too far cuz if we do this, see that? So
we're kind of killing

192
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:33,360
we're kind of killing
 

193
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,589
we're kind of killing
that effect. And then we can bring the

194
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:35,599
that effect. And then we can bring the
 

195
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,430
that effect. And then we can bring the
scale back up. And then obviously we can

196
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:37,440
scale back up. And then obviously we can
 

197
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,470
scale back up. And then obviously we can
bring the uh scale of the noise however

198
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:40,480
bring the uh scale of the noise however
 

199
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,149
bring the uh scale of the noise however
we want that to look. And we can adjust

200
00:03:42,149 --> 00:03:42,159
we want that to look. And we can adjust
 

201
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,949
we want that to look. And we can adjust
this um plenty later. Let's get a

202
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:46,959
this um plenty later. Let's get a
 

203
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,190
this um plenty later. Let's get a
set shade smooth node. And we're going

204
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:49,200
set shade smooth node. And we're going
 

205
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,030
set shade smooth node. And we're going
to go ahead

206
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,040
to go ahead
 

207
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,309
to go ahead
and actually I'm going to highlight

208
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:52,319
and actually I'm going to highlight
 

209
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,990
and actually I'm going to highlight
these, hit G, and get more space. Let's

210
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,000
these, hit G, and get more space. Let's
 

211
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,270
these, hit G, and get more space. Let's
go ahead and tile our uh displacement so

212
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:57,280
go ahead and tile our uh displacement so
 

213
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,750
go ahead and tile our uh displacement so
that this loop uh this animation can

214
00:03:59,750 --> 00:03:59,760
that this loop uh this animation can
 

215
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,070
that this loop uh this animation can
loop seamlessly. So what we're going to

216
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,080
loop seamlessly. So what we're going to
 

217
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,149
loop seamlessly. So what we're going to
do is get a transform geometry node.

218
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:06,159
do is get a transform geometry node.
 

219
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,630
do is get a transform geometry node.
a join geometry node and then plug the

220
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:08,640
a join geometry node and then plug the
 

221
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,869
a join geometry node and then plug the
set position into the join and this guy

222
00:04:10,869 --> 00:04:10,879
set position into the join and this guy
 

223
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,429
set position into the join and this guy
is now a duplicate. So we can go I know

224
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:13,439
is now a duplicate. So we can go I know
 

225
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,229
is now a duplicate. So we can go I know
this guy is 40 by 40. So if I just go

226
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:16,239
this guy is 40 by 40. So if I just go
 

227
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,150
this guy is 40 by 40. So if I just go
ahead and move this on the Y or the X by

228
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:20,160
ahead and move this on the Y or the X by
 

229
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,909
ahead and move this on the Y or the X by
40,

230
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:21,919
40,
 

231
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:24,070
40,
it is going to bring it exactly one

232
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,080
it is going to bring it exactly one
 

233
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,990
it is going to bring it exactly one
space over. And if we chose to move it

234
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,000
space over. And if we chose to move it
 

235
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,870
space over. And if we chose to move it
on the X, let's go here on the X scale

236
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:28,880
on the X, let's go here on the X scale
 

237
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,629
on the X, let's go here on the X scale
and give it -1. And that creates a

238
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:32,639
and give it -1. And that creates a
 

239
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,350
and give it -1. And that creates a
mirror that we can then tile this. So

240
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:35,360
mirror that we can then tile this. So
 

241
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,870
mirror that we can then tile this. So
let's go ahead and get another transform

242
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:36,880
let's go ahead and get another transform
 

243
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,030
let's go ahead and get another transform
geometry node

244
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:39,040
geometry node
 

245
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,909
geometry node
and another join geometry and plug the

246
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:41,919
and another join geometry and plug the
 

247
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,230
and another join geometry and plug the
join into the join. Again, he is a

248
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:44,240
join into the join. Again, he is a
 

249
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,390
join into the join. Again, he is a
duplicate. So then we can bring this

250
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:46,400
duplicate. So then we can bring this
 

251
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,310
duplicate. So then we can bring this
down. And looks like it needs to be

252
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:48,320
down. And looks like it needs to be
 

253
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,350
down. And looks like it needs to be
what? 80. Yeah, 80 on the X. And now we

254
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:53,360
what? 80. Yeah, 80 on the X. And now we
 

255
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,189
what? 80. Yeah, 80 on the X. And now we
have

256
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:55,199
have
 

257
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,350
have
something that is uh going to be able to

258
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:57,360
something that is uh going to be able to
 

259
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,469
something that is uh going to be able to
once we run the camera down loopable

260
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:00,479
once we run the camera down loopable
 

261
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,950
once we run the camera down loopable
seamlessly. So let's go ahead and

262
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:02,960
seamlessly. So let's go ahead and
 

263
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,390
seamlessly. So let's go ahead and
actually animate that camera. So I'm

264
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:06,400
actually animate that camera. So I'm
 

265
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,029
actually animate that camera. So I'm
just going to position my viewport

266
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:09,039
just going to position my viewport
 

267
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,310
just going to position my viewport
wherever I want the relative camera

268
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:12,320
wherever I want the relative camera
 

269
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,310
wherever I want the relative camera
position to be. So something like this.

270
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:16,320
position to be. So something like this.
 

271
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,710
position to be. So something like this.
We'll go right about here. I'm going hit

272
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:18,720
We'll go right about here. I'm going hit
 

273
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,670
We'll go right about here. I'm going hit
shift A and then get a uh if I can find

274
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:21,680
shift A and then get a uh if I can find
 

275
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,070
shift A and then get a uh if I can find
it camera control alt0 we'll snap it to

276
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,080
it camera control alt0 we'll snap it to
 

277
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,350
it camera control alt0 we'll snap it to
view

278
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:27,360

 

279
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,870

and then I'm going to hit the tilda key

280
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:28,880
and then I'm going to hit the tilda key
 

281
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,230
and then I'm going to hit the tilda key
and I'm going to look at the position of

282
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:30,240
and I'm going to look at the position of
 

283
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,790
and I'm going to look at the position of
my camera. He needs to be at the very

284
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:32,800
my camera. He needs to be at the very
 

285
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,710
my camera. He needs to be at the very
edge of this geometry here. So I know my

286
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:36,720
edge of this geometry here. So I know my
 

287
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,909
edge of this geometry here. So I know my
camera needs to be moving on the X and

288
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:39,919
camera needs to be moving on the X and
 

289
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,150
camera needs to be moving on the X and
so looks like it needs to be -20

290
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,160
so looks like it needs to be -20
 

291
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,629
so looks like it needs to be -20
because that's how big this is. This is

292
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:46,639
because that's how big this is. This is
 

293
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,950
because that's how big this is. This is
40x 40 which means in kind of real space

294
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:48,960
40x 40 which means in kind of real space
 

295
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,510
40x 40 which means in kind of real space
it's 20 by 20. So now I can look at my

296
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:51,520
it's 20 by 20. So now I can look at my
 

297
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,230
it's 20 by 20. So now I can look at my
camera and we can go ahead and animate.

298
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:54,240
camera and we can go ahead and animate.
 

299
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,790
camera and we can go ahead and animate.
So first I'm just going to go ahead

300
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:56,800
So first I'm just going to go ahead
 

301
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,350
So first I'm just going to go ahead
click on my camera going to rotate it a

302
00:05:59,350 --> 00:05:59,360
click on my camera going to rotate it a
 

303
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,110
click on my camera going to rotate it a
little bit.

304
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:01,120
little bit.
 

305
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,110
little bit.
Something like that. And then I'm going

306
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,120
Something like that. And then I'm going
 

307
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,390
Something like that. And then I'm going
to hit and then I'm going to zoom it in

308
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:06,400
to hit and then I'm going to zoom it in
 

309
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,870
to hit and then I'm going to zoom it in
a little bit on the millimeters so that

310
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:08,880
a little bit on the millimeters so that
 

311
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,230
a little bit on the millimeters so that
all of my geometry is filling my screen.

312
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:12,240
all of my geometry is filling my screen.
 

313
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,510
all of my geometry is filling my screen.
So let's go ahead and create this

314
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:13,520
So let's go ahead and create this
 

315
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,309
So let's go ahead and create this
animation. I'm going to give myself

316
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:16,319
animation. I'm going to give myself
 

317
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,790
animation. I'm going to give myself
600 frames. I'm going to go back to

318
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:18,800
600 frames. I'm going to go back to
 

319
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,870
600 frames. I'm going to go back to
frame one and make sure in your

320
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:20,880
frame one and make sure in your
 

321
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,950
frame one and make sure in your
preferences in the animation, your

322
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:22,960
preferences in the animation, your
 

323
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,629
preferences in the animation, your
default interpolation is linear. So, we

324
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:26,639
default interpolation is linear. So, we
 

325
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,950
default interpolation is linear. So, we
can look at this from the tilt key uh

326
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:28,960
can look at this from the tilt key uh
 

327
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,550
can look at this from the tilt key uh
the top view here. I'm looking at my

328
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:30,560
the top view here. I'm looking at my
 

329
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,469
the top view here. I'm looking at my
camera. We'll go to the settings here.

330
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:32,479
camera. We'll go to the settings here.
 

331
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,749
camera. We'll go to the settings here.
Make sure you are again at frame zero.

332
00:06:35,749 --> 00:06:35,759
Make sure you are again at frame zero.
 

333
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,909
Make sure you are again at frame zero.
Right here on the X, make sure he is at

334
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:39,919
Right here on the X, make sure he is at
 

335
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,830
Right here on the X, make sure he is at
20.

336
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:41,840
20.
 

337
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,670
20.
Hit the key frame and go to the very end

338
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:43,680
Hit the key frame and go to the very end
 

339
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,430
Hit the key frame and go to the very end
to frame 600. And I know that he needs

340
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:47,440
to frame 600. And I know that he needs
 

341
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,510
to frame 600. And I know that he needs
to be

342
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:49,520
to be
 

343
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,830
to be
see this seam right here. Skip this

344
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:51,840
see this seam right here. Skip this
 

345
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,990
see this seam right here. Skip this
seam. And you need to stop it at this

346
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,000
seam. And you need to stop it at this
 

347
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,270
seam. And you need to stop it at this
seam. So I'm going to go back to my

348
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:55,280
seam. So I'm going to go back to my
 

349
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,550
seam. So I'm going to go back to my
camera and just eyeball that. So I'm

350
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:58,560
camera and just eyeball that. So I'm
 

351
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,550
camera and just eyeball that. So I'm
going to go ahead hold down control and

352
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:00,560
going to go ahead hold down control and
 

353
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,629
going to go ahead hold down control and
go all the way to that seam, which is

354
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:02,639
go all the way to that seam, which is
 

355
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,710
go all the way to that seam, which is
going to be 60. So if you just want to

356
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:04,720
going to be 60. So if you just want to
 

357
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,469
going to be 60. So if you just want to
type in, go to the end of your timeline,

358
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:06,479
type in, go to the end of your timeline,
 

359
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,790
type in, go to the end of your timeline,
type in 60, hit the key frame, you are

360
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:08,800
type in 60, hit the key frame, you are
 

361
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,070
type in 60, hit the key frame, you are
going to be exactly where you need to

362
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,080
going to be exactly where you need to
 

363
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,629
going to be exactly where you need to
be. So, I'm going to bring my We can see

364
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:12,639
be. So, I'm going to bring my We can see
 

365
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,029
be. So, I'm going to bring my We can see
we can see. Let's make sure this loops

366
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:15,039
we can see. Let's make sure this loops
 

367
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,550
we can see. Let's make sure this loops
seamlessly. So, once he gets to the end

368
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:16,560
seamlessly. So, once he gets to the end
 

369
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,950
seamlessly. So, once he gets to the end
and restarts, it will look seamless. So,

370
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:18,960
and restarts, it will look seamless. So,
 

371
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,749
and restarts, it will look seamless. So,
I'm going to press play.

372
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:21,759
I'm going to press play.
 

373
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,589
I'm going to press play.
Go to the end. Perfect. This is a

374
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:23,599
Go to the end. Perfect. This is a
 

375
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,390
Go to the end. Perfect. This is a
perfect seamless loop. So, now we can

376
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:26,400
perfect seamless loop. So, now we can
 

377
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,790
perfect seamless loop. So, now we can
focus on uh the shading of this

378
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:28,800
focus on uh the shading of this
 

379
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,790
focus on uh the shading of this
animation. So, I'm going to bring my

380
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:30,800
animation. So, I'm going to bring my
 

381
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,589
animation. So, I'm going to bring my
detail down a little bit on these hills

382
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:33,599
detail down a little bit on these hills
 

383
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,110
detail down a little bit on these hills
and maybe flatten a few things out here.

384
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:37,120
and maybe flatten a few things out here.
 

385
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,270
and maybe flatten a few things out here.
Something like this.

386
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:39,280
Something like this.
 

387
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,150
Something like this.
Bring my scale up.

388
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:42,160
Bring my scale up.
 

389
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,629
Bring my scale up.
Bring my strength up. There we go. Have

390
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:44,639
Bring my strength up. There we go. Have
 

391
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,110
Bring my strength up. There we go. Have
a little bit of fun. So, let's go ahead

392
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:47,120
a little bit of fun. So, let's go ahead
 

393
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,430
a little bit of fun. So, let's go ahead
and add some shading. So, right over

394
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:49,440
and add some shading. So, right over
 

395
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,870
and add some shading. So, right over
here, let's go ahead and get a shader, a

396
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:52,880
here, let's go ahead and get a shader, a
 

397
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,670
here, let's go ahead and get a shader, a
emission, and then we can go over here,

398
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:55,680
emission, and then we can go over here,
 

399
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,510
emission, and then we can go over here,
get a

400
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:57,520
get a
 

401
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,830
get a
set material node, and grab that. And

402
00:07:59,830 --> 00:07:59,840
set material node, and grab that. And
 

403
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,990
set material node, and grab that. And
then let's head over to shading. I'm

404
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,000
then let's head over to shading. I'm
 

405
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,869
then let's head over to shading. I'm
going to go ahead and get my windows the

406
00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:04,879
going to go ahead and get my windows the
 

407
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,710
going to go ahead and get my windows the
way I want them to be. So, this one

408
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:06,720
way I want them to be. So, this one
 

409
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,270
way I want them to be. So, this one
being the 3D viewport, this one being

410
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:09,280
being the 3D viewport, this one being
 

411
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,350
being the 3D viewport, this one being
the shader editor. So, first let's go

412
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:11,360
the shader editor. So, first let's go
 

413
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,990
the shader editor. So, first let's go
ahead and let's get a color ramp. Plug

414
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:14,000
ahead and let's get a color ramp. Plug
 

415
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,469
ahead and let's get a color ramp. Plug
this into here. I'm going to hit I'm

416
00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:16,479
this into here. I'm going to hit I'm
 

417
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,869
this into here. I'm going to hit I'm
going to hit CtrlT. I'm going to go over

418
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:18,879
going to hit CtrlT. I'm going to go over
 

419
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,029
going to hit CtrlT. I'm going to go over
the factor I mean over the image texture

420
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:21,039
the factor I mean over the image texture
 

421
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,430
the factor I mean over the image texture
and use the object coordinate. And then

422
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:23,440
and use the object coordinate. And then
 

423
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,710
and use the object coordinate. And then
I'm going to get a separate XYZ and I'm

424
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:26,720
I'm going to get a separate XYZ and I'm
 

425
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,430
I'm going to get a separate XYZ and I'm
going to define it to the Z so that we

426
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:29,440
going to define it to the Z so that we
 

427
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,830
going to define it to the Z so that we
can start to see this uh gradient

428
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:31,840
can start to see this uh gradient
 

429
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,149
can start to see this uh gradient
working. Next thing I want to do, you

430
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:34,159
working. Next thing I want to do, you
 

431
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,029
working. Next thing I want to do, you
can also, you can control it here.

432
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:37,039
can also, you can control it here.
 

433
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,870
can also, you can control it here.
What I want to do before the color ramp

434
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:38,880
What I want to do before the color ramp
 

435
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,750
What I want to do before the color ramp
is get a map range. And the map range is

436
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:41,760
is get a map range. And the map range is
 

437
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,310
is get a map range. And the map range is
going to give us a really cool effect.

438
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:44,320
going to give us a really cool effect.
 

439
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,389
going to give us a really cool effect.
So, I'm going to go here, go from linear

440
00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:46,399
So, I'm going to go here, go from linear
 

441
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,350
So, I'm going to go here, go from linear
to stepped linear. And that's going to

442
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:49,360
to stepped linear. And that's going to
 

443
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,430
to stepped linear. And that's going to
give us these really cool steps that we

444
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:51,440
give us these really cool steps that we
 

445
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,910
give us these really cool steps that we
can use uh to make this look really

446
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:53,920
can use uh to make this look really
 

447
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,310
can use uh to make this look really
awesome. Now if you want to move the

448
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:56,320
awesome. Now if you want to move the
 

449
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,389
awesome. Now if you want to move the
gradient up, you can get another math

450
00:08:58,389 --> 00:08:58,399
gradient up, you can get another math
 

451
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,070
gradient up, you can get another math
node

452
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:00,080
node
 

453
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,790
node
and use the value to bring it up like

454
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:02,800
and use the value to bring it up like
 

455
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,910
and use the value to bring it up like
that.

456
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:05,920

 

457
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,389

You can bring it down. So all it's all

458
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:08,399
You can bring it down. So all it's all
 

459
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,310
You can bring it down. So all it's all
completely up to you. Here in the color

460
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:10,320
completely up to you. Here in the color
 

461
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,990
completely up to you. Here in the color
ramp, you can go ahead and define

462
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:12,000
ramp, you can go ahead and define
 

463
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,470
ramp, you can go ahead and define
whatever color you want this to be. So

464
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:14,480
whatever color you want this to be. So
 

465
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,070
whatever color you want this to be. So
we're going to go ahead and say maybe

466
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:18,080
we're going to go ahead and say maybe
 

467
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,030
we're going to go ahead and say maybe
maybe a nice green. Something like this.

468
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,040
maybe a nice green. Something like this.
 

469
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,790
maybe a nice green. Something like this.
And then this black portion is going to

470
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:24,800
And then this black portion is going to
 

471
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,710
And then this black portion is going to
be transparency. So let's go ahead and

472
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:26,720
be transparency. So let's go ahead and
 

473
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,350
be transparency. So let's go ahead and
get in a mix shader. Get a transparent

474
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:31,360
get in a mix shader. Get a transparent
 

475
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,990
get in a mix shader. Get a transparent
BSDF. Plug that here. And you're going

476
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,000
BSDF. Plug that here. And you're going
 

477
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,630
BSDF. Plug that here. And you're going
to see this really grainy transparency.

478
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:36,640
to see this really grainy transparency.
 

479
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,790
to see this really grainy transparency.
So here in the camera uh the camera

480
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:38,800
So here in the camera uh the camera
 

481
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,269
So here in the camera uh the camera
icon, I'm going to go here to Eevee.

482
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:41,279
icon, I'm going to go here to Eevee.
 

483
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,870
icon, I'm going to go here to Eevee.
Back to shading. You're going to see

484
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:42,880
Back to shading. You're going to see
 

485
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,350
Back to shading. You're going to see
dithered. Blended is going to give you

486
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:45,360
dithered. Blended is going to give you
 

487
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,470
dithered. Blended is going to give you
that nice smooth um transparency. Now

488
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:48,480
that nice smooth um transparency. Now
 

489
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,829
that nice smooth um transparency. Now
we'll put our world brightness to black.

490
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:51,839
we'll put our world brightness to black.
 

491
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,590
we'll put our world brightness to black.
And then we can throw some stuff here on

492
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:53,600
And then we can throw some stuff here on
 

493
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,710
And then we can throw some stuff here on
the bottom. But now we can go ahead and

494
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:56,720
the bottom. But now we can go ahead and
 

495
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,430
the bottom. But now we can go ahead and
say get another color ramp

496
00:09:59,430 --> 00:09:59,440
say get another color ramp
 

497
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,910
say get another color ramp
and define our transparency. So plug

498
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:01,920
and define our transparency. So plug
 

499
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,590
and define our transparency. So plug
plug the map range into the color a ramp

500
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:03,600
plug the map range into the color a ramp
 

501
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,509
plug the map range into the color a ramp
and the color a ramp into the factor.

502
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:05,519
and the color a ramp into the factor.
 

503
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,949
and the color a ramp into the factor.
And then we're going to flip the color

504
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:06,959
And then we're going to flip the color
 

505
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,670
And then we're going to flip the color
ramp. So now what's under this is going

506
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:09,680
ramp. So now what's under this is going
 

507
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,430
ramp. So now what's under this is going
to be transparent. You can kind of see

508
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:11,440
to be transparent. You can kind of see
 

509
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,990
to be transparent. You can kind of see
it working. You can see through. The

510
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:14,000
it working. You can see through. The
 

511
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,670
it working. You can see through. The
darker it is, the more you can see

512
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:15,680
darker it is, the more you can see
 

513
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,030
darker it is, the more you can see
through it. So that's great. Now you'll

514
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,040
through it. So that's great. Now you'll
 

515
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,710
through it. So that's great. Now you'll
notice how it's like all white up here.

516
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:18,720
notice how it's like all white up here.
 

517
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,750
notice how it's like all white up here.
There's no definition. You can take the

518
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:21,760
There's no definition. You can take the
 

519
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,910
There's no definition. You can take the
from max and bring it up a little bit

520
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:23,920
from max and bring it up a little bit
 

521
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,310
from max and bring it up a little bit
and that is going to allow a little bit

522
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:26,320
and that is going to allow a little bit
 

523
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,150
and that is going to allow a little bit
more um a little bit more I can't think

524
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:30,160
more um a little bit more I can't think
 

525
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,550
more um a little bit more I can't think
of the word not great with words today.

526
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:32,560
of the word not great with words today.
 

527
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,230
of the word not great with words today.
Uh but it's going to help with that

528
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,240
Uh but it's going to help with that
 

529
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,910
Uh but it's going to help with that
scale and that really interesting

530
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:35,920
scale and that really interesting
 

531
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,230
scale and that really interesting
stepped look and not look so flat on the

532
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:38,240
stepped look and not look so flat on the
 

533
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,430
stepped look and not look so flat on the
tops. Now let's go and add those

534
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:41,440
tops. Now let's go and add those
 

535
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,790
tops. Now let's go and add those
blinking lines that are in the

536
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:42,800
blinking lines that are in the
 

537
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,750
blinking lines that are in the
animation. And so we're going to go

538
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:43,760
animation. And so we're going to go
 

539
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,110
animation. And so we're going to go
ahead get another mix shader and we're

540
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:47,120
ahead get another mix shader and we're
 

541
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,269
ahead get another mix shader and we're
going to get a emission node. And I'm

542
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:49,279
going to get a emission node. And I'm
 

543
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,030
going to get a emission node. And I'm
just going to go ahead and click on

544
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,040
just going to go ahead and click on
 

545
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,350
just going to go ahead and click on
this. Hit Ctrl + C on this color. Ctrl

546
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:53,360
this. Hit Ctrl + C on this color. Ctrl
 

547
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,310
this. Hit Ctrl + C on this color. Ctrl
+V on that color. Plug it here. And

548
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:56,320
+V on that color. Plug it here. And
 

549
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,990
+V on that color. Plug it here. And
let's go ahead and get in a color ramp

550
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,000
let's go ahead and get in a color ramp
 

551
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,670
let's go ahead and get in a color ramp
to create this. We're going to get a

552
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:01,680
to create this. We're going to get a
 

553
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,590
to create this. We're going to get a
wave texture. And then we're going to

554
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:03,600
wave texture. And then we're going to
 

555
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,870
wave texture. And then we're going to
get a brand. We're going to hit control

556
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:04,880
get a brand. We're going to hit control
 

557
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,790
get a brand. We're going to hit control
T and get a brand new set of mapping

558
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:06,800
T and get a brand new set of mapping
 

559
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,470
T and get a brand new set of mapping
nodes. Plug color here. And then we're

560
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:10,480
nodes. Plug color here. And then we're
 

561
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,949
nodes. Plug color here. And then we're
going to switch from X to Z. and it's

562
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:12,959
going to switch from X to Z. and it's
 

563
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,710
going to switch from X to Z. and it's
going to create this really interesting

564
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:14,720
going to create this really interesting
 

565
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,790
going to create this really interesting
effect. We're going to we're going to go

566
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:16,800
effect. We're going to we're going to go
 

567
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,509
effect. We're going to we're going to go
from linear to constant.

568
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:19,519
from linear to constant.
 

569
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,269
from linear to constant.
But to make these lines even thinner,

570
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:21,279
But to make these lines even thinner,
 

571
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,190
But to make these lines even thinner,
you can switch this over to saw. And

572
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:23,200
you can switch this over to saw. And
 

573
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,630
you can switch this over to saw. And
that's going to allow a little bit more

574
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:24,640
that's going to allow a little bit more
 

575
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,750
that's going to allow a little bit more
of a thin uh line look. And then you can

576
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:27,760
of a thin uh line look. And then you can
 

577
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,389
of a thin uh line look. And then you can
just bring this up to see how many lines

578
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:30,399
just bring this up to see how many lines
 

579
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,150
just bring this up to see how many lines
you want to to do. You can get it to

580
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:32,160
you want to to do. You can get it to
 

581
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,910
you want to to do. You can get it to
line up with the steps. Um you don't

582
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:33,920
line up with the steps. Um you don't
 

583
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,630
line up with the steps. Um you don't
have to obviously, but whatever you want

584
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:36,640
have to obviously, but whatever you want
 

585
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,750
have to obviously, but whatever you want
to do, you can absolutely do. So you

586
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:39,760
to do, you can absolutely do. So you
 

587
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,230
to do, you can absolutely do. So you
have this. Now remember, we can play

588
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:42,240
have this. Now remember, we can play
 

589
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,230
have this. Now remember, we can play
with this thickness. So let's go ahead.

590
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:44,240
with this thickness. So let's go ahead.
 

591
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,030
with this thickness. So let's go ahead.
We have the lines. I want to get them uh

592
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,040
We have the lines. I want to get them uh
 

593
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,710
We have the lines. I want to get them uh
to be blinking in and out on the

594
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:50,720
to be blinking in and out on the
 

595
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,310
to be blinking in and out on the
scene. So one thing I want to do is

596
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:52,320
scene. So one thing I want to do is
 

597
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,670
scene. So one thing I want to do is
bring the emission strength down on the

598
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:55,680
bring the emission strength down on the
 

599
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,590
bring the emission strength down on the
emi on this emission node down here so

600
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:57,600
emi on this emission node down here so
 

601
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,670
emi on this emission node down here so
that we can see all of the lines and the

602
00:11:59,670 --> 00:11:59,680
that we can see all of the lines and the
 

603
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,630
that we can see all of the lines and the
lines being the brightest part of this

604
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:02,640
lines being the brightest part of this
 

605
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,509
lines being the brightest part of this
animation. So here's a really really fun

606
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:05,519
animation. So here's a really really fun
 

607
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,829
animation. So here's a really really fun
trick that I showed uh here on YouTube a

608
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:07,839
trick that I showed uh here on YouTube a
 

609
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,990
trick that I showed uh here on YouTube a
while back. We're going to take this.

610
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,000
while back. We're going to take this.
 

611
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,509
while back. We're going to take this.
I'm going to get a mix color.

612
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:13,519
I'm going to get a mix color.
 

613
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,190
I'm going to get a mix color.
So, this is plugged into A. I'm going to

614
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:15,200
So, this is plugged into A. I'm going to
 

615
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,470
So, this is plugged into A. I'm going to
hit control shift D. Again, that works

616
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:18,480
hit control shift D. Again, that works
 

617
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,829
hit control shift D. Again, that works
if you have the node wrangler add-on

618
00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:19,839
if you have the node wrangler add-on
 

619
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,750
if you have the node wrangler add-on
enabled or just plug the wave texture

620
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:21,760
enabled or just plug the wave texture
 

621
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,990
enabled or just plug the wave texture
into a new color ramp of a duplicate of

622
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,000
into a new color ramp of a duplicate of
 

623
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,949
into a new color ramp of a duplicate of
this one. Plug it into here. So, here on

624
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:26,959
this one. Plug it into here. So, here on
 

625
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,470
this one. Plug it into here. So, here on
this factor, I'm going to bring these

626
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:28,480
this factor, I'm going to bring these
 

627
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,550
this factor, I'm going to bring these
lines to be as thin as possible on the

628
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:30,560
lines to be as thin as possible on the
 

629
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,389
lines to be as thin as possible on the
color ramp. Bring the factor to the

630
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:32,399
color ramp. Bring the factor to the
 

631
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,069
color ramp. Bring the factor to the
right. And we'll just make them a little

632
00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:34,079
right. And we'll just make them a little
 

633
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,069
right. And we'll just make them a little
thicker.

634
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:36,079
thicker.
 

635
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,629
thicker.
And then, let's get another color ramp.

636
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:38,639
And then, let's get another color ramp.
 

637
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,550
And then, let's get another color ramp.
I'm hit shift D and bring it to the

638
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:40,560
I'm hit shift D and bring it to the
 

639
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,590
I'm hit shift D and bring it to the
middle. Control shift D on this wave

640
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:43,600
middle. Control shift D on this wave
 

641
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,269
middle. Control shift D on this wave
texture just so that he's still plugged

642
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:45,279
texture just so that he's still plugged
 

643
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,389
texture just so that he's still plugged
into the mapping. Plug it into there and

644
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:48,399
into the mapping. Plug it into there and
 

645
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,269
into the mapping. Plug it into there and
then plug him into the factor. Once we

646
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:51,279
then plug him into the factor. Once we
 

647
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,230
then plug him into the factor. Once we
get a smaller scale, so maybe 0.5,

648
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:54,240
get a smaller scale, so maybe 0.5,
 

649
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,310
get a smaller scale, so maybe 0.5,
you're going to get this difference in

650
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:56,320
you're going to get this difference in
 

651
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,310
you're going to get this difference in
thickness. And so it's using a wave

652
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:58,320
thickness. And so it's using a wave
 

653
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,590
thickness. And so it's using a wave
texture to mask out um some of the

654
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:03,600
texture to mask out um some of the
 

655
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,269
texture to mask out um some of the
thicker lines and the thinner lines. So

656
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:05,279
thicker lines and the thinner lines. So
 

657
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,590
thicker lines and the thinner lines. So
you can have some fun

658
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:07,600
you can have some fun
 

659
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,069
you can have some fun
with that. And it's really really cool.

660
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:10,079
with that. And it's really really cool.
 

661
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,590
with that. And it's really really cool.
If you go to the compositing, I'm click

662
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:11,600
If you go to the compositing, I'm click
 

663
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,870
If you go to the compositing, I'm click
use nodes. I'm going get a glare node

664
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:14,880
use nodes. I'm going get a glare node
 

665
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,350
use nodes. I'm going get a glare node
set to fog glow. We'll go back to

666
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:17,360
set to fog glow. We'll go back to
 

667
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,350
set to fog glow. We'll go back to
shading. And I'm going to hit this and

668
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:19,360
shading. And I'm going to hit this and
 

669
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,430
shading. And I'm going to hit this and
click on always. What's going to happen

670
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:21,440
click on always. What's going to happen
 

671
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,110
click on always. What's going to happen
is we can bring up when we get this

672
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:23,120
is we can bring up when we get this
 

673
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,629
is we can bring up when we get this
emission node here. I'm going to bring

674
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:24,639
emission node here. I'm going to bring
 

675
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,790
emission node here. I'm going to bring
up the brightness so that the thicker

676
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:26,800
up the brightness so that the thicker
 

677
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,870
up the brightness so that the thicker
ones are going to glow.

678
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:28,880
ones are going to glow.
 

679
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,710
ones are going to glow.
Then you play with the phase offset. And

680
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:30,720
Then you play with the phase offset. And
 

681
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,710
Then you play with the phase offset. And
now you have this. Now, one thing I want

682
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:32,720
now you have this. Now, one thing I want
 

683
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,350
now you have this. Now, one thing I want
to do is eliminate some of the lines

684
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:35,360
to do is eliminate some of the lines
 

685
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,550
to do is eliminate some of the lines
down here. So, it's still topographic

686
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:38,560
down here. So, it's still topographic
 

687
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,190
down here. So, it's still topographic
map looking. How am I going to do that?

688
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:41,200
map looking. How am I going to do that?
 

689
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,629
map looking. How am I going to do that?
So, I'm going to hit G and move these

690
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:42,639
So, I'm going to hit G and move these
 

691
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,829
So, I'm going to hit G and move these
over. This emission node is handling the

692
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:45,839
over. This emission node is handling the
 

693
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,069
over. This emission node is handling the
lines. So, what I want to do is just get

694
00:13:48,069 --> 00:13:48,079
lines. So, what I want to do is just get
 

695
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,230
lines. So, what I want to do is just get
another mix shader. So, I'm going to

696
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:50,240
another mix shader. So, I'm going to
 

697
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,990
another mix shader. So, I'm going to
give myself a little bit more space here

698
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:52,000
give myself a little bit more space here
 

699
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,190
give myself a little bit more space here
just so it because it's going to start

700
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:53,200
just so it because it's going to start
 

701
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,470
just so it because it's going to start
getting a little wild. We're going to

702
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:54,480
getting a little wild. We're going to
 

703
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,230
getting a little wild. We're going to
get another transparent BSDF. You could

704
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:58,240
get another transparent BSDF. You could
 

705
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,829
get another transparent BSDF. You could
just plug this one over here, but just

706
00:13:59,829 --> 00:13:59,839
just plug this one over here, but just
 

707
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,550
just plug this one over here, but just
to keep things visually in a good spot,

708
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:02,560
to keep things visually in a good spot,
 

709
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,990
to keep things visually in a good spot,
I'm going to just get a new transparent

710
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm going to just get a new transparent
 

711
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,030
I'm going to just get a new transparent
node. What I want to do, I give myself

712
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,040
node. What I want to do, I give myself
 

713
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,629
node. What I want to do, I give myself
some more space here, is get a color

714
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:08,639
some more space here, is get a color
 

715
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,790
some more space here, is get a color
ramp

716
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:10,800
ramp
 

717
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,470
ramp
so we can plug something into it. What I

718
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:12,480
so we can plug something into it. What I
 

719
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,269
so we can plug something into it. What I
want to plug into it is the map range

720
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:15,279
want to plug into it is the map range
 

721
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,269
want to plug into it is the map range
that is creating this gradient because

722
00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:17,279
that is creating this gradient because
 

723
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,150
that is creating this gradient because
we want to use a gradient to say kill

724
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:20,160
we want to use a gradient to say kill
 

725
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,550
we want to use a gradient to say kill
some of these uh lines down here.

726
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:24,560
some of these uh lines down here.
 

727
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,670
some of these uh lines down here.
So, I'm going to plug the map range

728
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:27,680
So, I'm going to plug the map range
 

729
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,310
So, I'm going to plug the map range
into the color ramp. And then I'm just

730
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:30,320
into the color ramp. And then I'm just
 

731
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,030
into the color ramp. And then I'm just
going to flip the color ramp. And as you

732
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,040
going to flip the color ramp. And as you
 

733
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,269
going to flip the color ramp. And as you
can see, once we move the white one, it

734
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:35,279
can see, once we move the white one, it
 

735
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,990
can see, once we move the white one, it
removes some of those. I'm going to use

736
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:38,000
removes some of those. I'm going to use
 

737
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,069
removes some of those. I'm going to use
a constant offset so it's a little bit

738
00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:40,079
a constant offset so it's a little bit
 

739
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,230
a constant offset so it's a little bit
more precise.

740
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:42,240
more precise.
 

741
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,910
more precise.
I just want like that big one on the

742
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:43,920
I just want like that big one on the
 

743
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,550
I just want like that big one on the
bottom gone. So now when we go back to

744
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:46,560
bottom gone. So now when we go back to
 

745
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,870
bottom gone. So now when we go back to
this top wave texture,

746
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:48,880
this top wave texture,
 

747
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,550
this top wave texture,
it looks a little better in my opinion.

748
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:52,560
it looks a little better in my opinion.
 

749
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,350
it looks a little better in my opinion.
So there we go. We are pretty much done

750
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:55,360
So there we go. We are pretty much done
 

751
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,030
So there we go. We are pretty much done
with this animation. One thing I want to

752
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:57,040
with this animation. One thing I want to
 

753
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,710
with this animation. One thing I want to
do

754
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:58,720
do
 

755
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,910
do
is get a grid floor

756
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:01,920
is get a grid floor
 

757
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,509
is get a grid floor
so it looks like that classic

758
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:03,519
so it looks like that classic
 

759
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,550
so it looks like that classic
topographic maps uh vibe. So I'm going

760
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:06,560
topographic maps uh vibe. So I'm going
 

761
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,550
topographic maps uh vibe. So I'm going
to get a plane and I'm going to hit S20.

762
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:10,560
to get a plane and I'm going to hit S20.
 

763
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,949
to get a plane and I'm going to hit S20.
Hit control A, apply that scale. Then

764
00:15:12,949 --> 00:15:12,959
Hit control A, apply that scale. Then
 

765
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,990
Hit control A, apply that scale. Then
I'm going to hit Alt D holding down

766
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:16,000
I'm going to hit Alt D holding down
 

767
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,829
I'm going to hit Alt D holding down
control and snapping each one to the

768
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:17,839
control and snapping each one to the
 

769
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,189
control and snapping each one to the
edge. Alt D, holding down control, snap

770
00:15:21,189 --> 00:15:21,199
edge. Alt D, holding down control, snap
 

771
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,870
edge. Alt D, holding down control, snap
it to the edge. Alt D.

772
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:24,880
it to the edge. Alt D.
 

773
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,389
it to the edge. Alt D.
There we go. So now I'm going to take

774
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:28,399
There we go. So now I'm going to take
 

775
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,790
There we go. So now I'm going to take
this, bring it up so that the the plane

776
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:30,800
this, bring it up so that the the plane
 

777
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,350
this, bring it up so that the the plane
isn't connecting to the bottom. Select

778
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:33,360
isn't connecting to the bottom. Select
 

779
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,870
isn't connecting to the bottom. Select
this bottom plane. Now the reason why we

780
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:34,880
this bottom plane. Now the reason why we
 

781
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,110
this bottom plane. Now the reason why we
did alt D is when we add a material to

782
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:37,120
did alt D is when we add a material to
 

783
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,310
did alt D is when we add a material to
this plane, it's going to add it to

784
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:38,320
this plane, it's going to add it to
 

785
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,590
this plane, it's going to add it to
those planes, too, because they are

786
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:39,600
those planes, too, because they are
 

787
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,110
those planes, too, because they are
instances. So let's head back to

788
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:41,120
instances. So let's head back to
 

789
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,509
instances. So let's head back to
shading. I'm going to click new. I'm

790
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:43,519
shading. I'm going to click new. I'm
 

791
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:44,790
shading. I'm going to click new. I'm
going hit period to bring up that

792
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:44,800
going hit period to bring up that
 

793
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,870
going hit period to bring up that
principled emission. We're just going to

794
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:46,880
principled emission. We're just going to
 

795
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,389
principled emission. We're just going to
give it a strength of like three. So

796
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:48,399
give it a strength of like three. So
 

797
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,470
give it a strength of like three. So
yep, we can see it through our

798
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:50,480
yep, we can see it through our
 

799
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,230
yep, we can see it through our
mountains.

800
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:52,240
mountains.
 

801
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,710
mountains.
Let's get a color ramp.

802
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:54,720
Let's get a color ramp.
 

803
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,629
Let's get a color ramp.
plug it here. And then I'm going to

804
00:15:56,629 --> 00:15:56,639
plug it here. And then I'm going to
 

805
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:57,670
plug it here. And then I'm going to
click on the mountains. I'm just going

806
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:57,680
click on the mountains. I'm just going
 

807
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,550
click on the mountains. I'm just going
to copy this color. And then click back

808
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:00,560
to copy this color. And then click back
 

809
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,110
to copy this color. And then click back
on this bottom plane, paste it there.

810
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:03,120
on this bottom plane, paste it there.
 

811
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,150
on this bottom plane, paste it there.
We're going to get a Voronoi texture.

812
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,160
We're going to get a Voronoi texture.
 

813
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,269
We're going to get a Voronoi texture.
Hit CtrlT. And use the object coordinate

814
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:09,279
Hit CtrlT. And use the object coordinate
 

815
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,870
Hit CtrlT. And use the object coordinate
distance here. Bring the randomness in.

816
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:12,880
distance here. Bring the randomness in.
 

817
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,230
distance here. Bring the randomness in.
And we're going to go from uklidian to

818
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:14,240
And we're going to go from uklidian to
 

819
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,230
And we're going to go from uklidian to
chvy.

820
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:16,240
chvy.
 

821
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,829
chvy.
Bring that scale to like

822
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:19,839
Bring that scale to like
 

823
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,389
Bring that scale to like
three. We're going to go from linear to

824
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:22,399
three. We're going to go from linear to
 

825
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,949
three. We're going to go from linear to
constant.

826
00:16:24,949 --> 00:16:24,959
constant.
 

827
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,110
constant.
Where's our grid? There it is. And then

828
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:27,120
Where's our grid? There it is. And then
 

829
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,790
Where's our grid? There it is. And then
we're going to try to make our grid as

830
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:28,800
we're going to try to make our grid as
 

831
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,389
we're going to try to make our grid as
thin

832
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:30,399
thin
 

833
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,550
thin
as possible. There we go. And what I

834
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:32,560
as possible. There we go. And what I
 

835
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,949
as possible. There we go. And what I
like to do

836
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:34,959
like to do
 

837
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,269
like to do
is actually I'm going to se select all

838
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:37,279
is actually I'm going to se select all
 

839
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,949
is actually I'm going to se select all
of these planes by holding down shift

840
00:16:40,949 --> 00:16:40,959
of these planes by holding down shift
 

841
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,430
of these planes by holding down shift
and I'm going to bring them down so that

842
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:43,440
and I'm going to bring them down so that
 

843
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,829
and I'm going to bring them down so that
there's a parallax effect. So I'm going

844
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:45,839
there's a parallax effect. So I'm going
 

845
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,550
there's a parallax effect. So I'm going
to bring them over. So when I press

846
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:48,560
to bring them over. So when I press
 

847
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,710
to bring them over. So when I press
play,

848
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:50,720
play,
 

849
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,790
play,
you can see it kind of looks like the

850
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:52,800
you can see it kind of looks like the
 

851
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,790
you can see it kind of looks like the
mountains are moving faster than that

852
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:54,800
mountains are moving faster than that
 

853
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,030
mountains are moving faster than that
bottom grid. So it's going to create

854
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:57,040
bottom grid. So it's going to create
 

855
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,910
bottom grid. So it's going to create
this really, really cool, quite subtle

856
00:16:59,910 --> 00:16:59,920
this really, really cool, quite subtle
 

857
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,269
this really, really cool, quite subtle
parallax effect. And then I'm just going

858
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:01,279
parallax effect. And then I'm just going
 

859
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,949
parallax effect. And then I'm just going
to bring down the brightness of the grid

860
00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:02,959
to bring down the brightness of the grid
 

861
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,669
to bring down the brightness of the grid
on the bottom.

862
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:05,679
on the bottom.
 

863
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,270
on the bottom.
And now if I press play,

864
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:09,280
And now if I press play,
 

865
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,909
And now if I press play,
it has this really cool effect. Last

866
00:17:11,909 --> 00:17:11,919
it has this really cool effect. Last
 

867
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,750
it has this really cool effect. Last
thing we need to do is animate

868
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:15,760
thing we need to do is animate
 

869
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,990
thing we need to do is animate
the phase offset here. So, I'm going to

870
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:18,000
the phase offset here. So, I'm going to
 

871
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,590
the phase offset here. So, I'm going to
give myself a timeline.

872
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:21,600
give myself a timeline.
 

873
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,230
give myself a timeline.
I have 600 frames.

874
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:24,240
I have 600 frames.
 

875
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,510
I have 600 frames.
So, I'm just going to give myself some

876
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:25,520
So, I'm just going to give myself some
 

877
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,069
So, I'm just going to give myself some
space for this timeline. Go back to

878
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:28,079
space for this timeline. Go back to
 

879
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,710
space for this timeline. Go back to
frame zero. And to get the phase offset

880
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:30,720
frame zero. And to get the phase offset
 

881
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,630
frame zero. And to get the phase offset
of a wave texture to loop, you have to

882
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:32,640
of a wave texture to loop, you have to
 

883
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,470
of a wave texture to loop, you have to
use pi. So, if you've never done it,

884
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:34,480
use pi. So, if you've never done it,
 

885
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,990
use pi. So, if you've never done it,
it's extremely easy. Hit I, go to the

886
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:38,000
it's extremely easy. Hit I, go to the
 

887
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,909
it's extremely easy. Hit I, go to the
very end, and I'm going to type in 10.

888
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:39,919
very end, and I'm going to type in 10.
 

889
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,909
very end, and I'm going to type in 10.
You need to use an even number. 10 times

890
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:41,919
You need to use an even number. 10 times
 

891
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,950
You need to use an even number. 10 times
or asterisk pi.

892
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:44,960
or asterisk pi.
 

893
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,710
or asterisk pi.
And that's really slow. So I'm going to

894
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:46,720
And that's really slow. So I'm going to
 

895
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,630
And that's really slow. So I'm going to
do maybe

896
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:48,640
do maybe
 

897
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,350
do maybe
30 asterisk pi. Hit I.

898
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:53,360
30 asterisk pi. Hit I.
 

899
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,390
30 asterisk pi. Hit I.
There we go.

900
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:58,400

 

901
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,510

And we now have

902
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:03,520

 

903
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,430

in fact let's make it even faster. So

904
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:05,440
in fact let's make it even faster. So
 

905
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,630
in fact let's make it even faster. So
we'll do I don't know

906
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:08,640
we'll do I don't know
 

907
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,310
we'll do I don't know
40 asterisk pi

908
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:12,320
40 asterisk pi
 

909
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,070
40 asterisk pi
hit I

910
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:14,080
hit I
 

911
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,590
hit I
and then I'm going to play with the

912
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:15,600
and then I'm going to play with the
 

913
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,590
and then I'm going to play with the
scale.

914
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:19,600

 

915
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,230

The smaller the value of the wave, the

916
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:22,240
The smaller the value of the wave, the
 

917
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,870
The smaller the value of the wave, the
smoother this effect is going to look.

918
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:24,880
smoother this effect is going to look.
 

919
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,150
smoother this effect is going to look.
So like this is pretty cool and

920
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:26,160
So like this is pretty cool and
 

921
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,630
So like this is pretty cool and
dramatic.

922
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:28,640
dramatic.
 

923
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,549
dramatic.
And I

924
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:30,559
And I
 

925
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,789
And I
I think this is really really really

926
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:32,799
I think this is really really really
 

927
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,190
I think this is really really really
cool.

928
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:35,200
cool.
 

929
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,590
cool.
And this is how you create this

930
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:37,600
And this is how you create this
 

931
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,150
And this is how you create this
animation. Super fun, super cool, super

932
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:40,160
animation. Super fun, super cool, super
 

933
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,909
animation. Super fun, super cool, super
easy. What we can do now is just go

934
00:18:41,909 --> 00:18:41,919
easy. What we can do now is just go
 

935
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,029
easy. What we can do now is just go
ahead and export it. So, I'm going to

936
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:43,039
ahead and export it. So, I'm going to
 

937
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,430
ahead and export it. So, I'm going to
use 1920 x 1080. I highly recommend

938
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:45,440
use 1920 x 1080. I highly recommend
 

939
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,110
use 1920 x 1080. I highly recommend
using a PNG sequence. Just pick a

940
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:47,120
using a PNG sequence. Just pick a
 

941
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,510
using a PNG sequence. Just pick a
folder. Just pick your folder, send it

942
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:49,520
folder. Just pick your folder, send it
 

943
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,150
folder. Just pick your folder, send it
in there, and uh compile it. If you

944
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:52,160
in there, and uh compile it. If you
 

945
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,390
in there, and uh compile it. If you
don't want to do that, you can do FFmpeg

946
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:54,400
don't want to do that, you can do FFmpeg
 

947
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,150
don't want to do that, you can do FFmpeg
video encoding to MP4 or QuickTime if

948
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:58,160
video encoding to MP4 or QuickTime if
 

949
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,630
video encoding to MP4 or QuickTime if
you're on Mac. and then medium quality

950

animation. And when you're done, you'll

954
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:05,840
animation. And when you're done, you'll
 

955
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,029
animation. And when you're done, you'll
have something really cool like mine.
