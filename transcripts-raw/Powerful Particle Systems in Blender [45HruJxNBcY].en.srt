00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,950

All right, this video is about particle

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:02,960
All right, this video is about particle
 

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,269
All right, this video is about particle
systems in geometry nodes. I want to

4
00:00:05,269 --> 00:00:05,279
systems in geometry nodes. I want to
 

5
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,510
systems in geometry nodes. I want to
show you a ton of different ways that we

6
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:07,520
show you a ton of different ways that we
 

7
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,669
show you a ton of different ways that we
can first set them up, uh, get them

8
00:00:09,669 --> 00:00:09,679
can first set them up, uh, get them
 

9
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,230
can first set them up, uh, get them
shaped to really cool stuff, animating

10
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:12,240
shaped to really cool stuff, animating
 

11
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,030
shaped to really cool stuff, animating
in really, really cool ways. A lot of it

12
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:15,040
in really, really cool ways. A lot of it
 

13
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,630
in really, really cool ways. A lot of it
is really not that complicated. You

14
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:16,640
is really not that complicated. You
 

15
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,230
is really not that complicated. You
don't need to be an expert or super

16
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:18,240
don't need to be an expert or super
 

17
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,990
don't need to be an expert or super
proficient in geometry nodes to do some

18
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:20,000
proficient in geometry nodes to do some
 

19
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,109
proficient in geometry nodes to do some
of these things. So, I'm going to show

20
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:21,119
of these things. So, I'm going to show
 

21
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,269
of these things. So, I'm going to show
you how to get them to be shaped in ways

22
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:23,279
you how to get them to be shaped in ways
 

23
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,189
you how to get them to be shaped in ways
that you want them for your ideas. I'm

24
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:25,199
that you want them for your ideas. I'm
 

25
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,790
that you want them for your ideas. I'm
going to show you different ways to

26
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:26,800
going to show you different ways to
 

27
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,710
going to show you different ways to
animate them and control the movements

28
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:28,720
animate them and control the movements
 

29
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,310
animate them and control the movements
so it doesn't really feel like you're

30
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:30,320
so it doesn't really feel like you're
 

31
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,990
so it doesn't really feel like you're
kind of at the mercy of textures and

32
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:32,000
kind of at the mercy of textures and
 

33
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,990
kind of at the mercy of textures and
things like that. And I want to show you

34
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:34,000
things like that. And I want to show you
 

35
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,310
things like that. And I want to show you
how to get them to look good, like

36
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:36,320
how to get them to look good, like
 

37
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,229
how to get them to look good, like
changing different object variations,

38
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:38,239
changing different object variations,
 

39
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,310
changing different object variations,
scales, textures, lighting. I'm going to

40
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:40,320
scales, textures, lighting. I'm going to
 

41
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,590
scales, textures, lighting. I'm going to
be showing five different animations

So with that being said, let's learn how

68
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:05,600
So with that being said, let's learn how
 

69
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,350
So with that being said, let's learn how
to make cool particle systems. Okay,

70
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:07,360
to make cool particle systems. Okay,
 

71
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,950
to make cool particle systems. Okay,
let's start with like the super basic

72
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:08,960
let's start with like the super basic
 

73
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,429
let's start with like the super basic
stuff just just right now and then we'll

74
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:11,439
stuff just just right now and then we'll
 

75
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,429
stuff just just right now and then we'll
very quickly get into some cool stuff.

76
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:13,439
very quickly get into some cool stuff.
 

77
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,670
very quickly get into some cool stuff.
So first just open up two windows. We're

78
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:15,680
So first just open up two windows. We're
 

79
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,590
So first just open up two windows. We're
going to throw in any piece of geometry

80
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:17,600
going to throw in any piece of geometry
 

81
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,109
going to throw in any piece of geometry
and then I'm going to switch this to the

82
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:19,119
and then I'm going to switch this to the
 

83
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,749
and then I'm going to switch this to the
geo node editor. I'm going to click new.

84
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:21,759
geo node editor. I'm going to click new.
 

85
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,789
geo node editor. I'm going to click new.
So there's two ways to get particles

86
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:24,799
So there's two ways to get particles
 

87
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,950
So there's two ways to get particles
available in your scene. It's you can

88
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:26,960
available in your scene. It's you can
 

89
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,190
available in your scene. It's you can
either distribute them on something or

90
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:29,200
either distribute them on something or
 

91
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,789
either distribute them on something or
in something. So I'll use that idea with

92
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:32,799
in something. So I'll use that idea with
 

93
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,350
in something. So I'll use that idea with
an icosphere. So scale it up, subdivide

94
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:35,360
an icosphere. So scale it up, subdivide
 

95
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,870
an icosphere. So scale it up, subdivide
it. You could first do a distribute

96
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:36,880
it. You could first do a distribute
 

97
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,190
it. You could first do a distribute
points on faces and it's going to

98
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:39,200
points on faces and it's going to
 

99
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,710
points on faces and it's going to
randomly place points all over any

100
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:42,720
randomly place points all over any
 

101
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,630
randomly place points all over any
geometry you put in geometry notes. That

102
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:44,640
geometry you put in geometry notes. That
 

103
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,749
geometry you put in geometry notes. That
be letters, logos, any any geometry you

104
00:01:47,749 --> 00:01:47,759
be letters, logos, any any geometry you
 

105
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,550
be letters, logos, any any geometry you
can put it on it like it's a shell. or

106
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:50,560
can put it on it like it's a shell. or
 

107
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,270
can put it on it like it's a shell. or
again taking any piece of geometry, you

108
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:53,280
again taking any piece of geometry, you
 

109
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,830
again taking any piece of geometry, you
can convert it into a volume and you can

110
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:55,840
can convert it into a volume and you can
 

111
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,069
can convert it into a volume and you can
do a distribute points in volume and

112
00:01:58,069 --> 00:01:58,079
do a distribute points in volume and
 

113
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,270
do a distribute points in volume and
that's of course going to put the

114
00:01:59,270 --> 00:01:59,280
that's of course going to put the
 

115
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,910
that's of course going to put the
objects within the volume of whatever

116
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:01,920
objects within the volume of whatever
 

117
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,429
objects within the volume of whatever
you put it in. So if you're doing logos

118
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:03,439
you put it in. So if you're doing logos
 

119
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,709
you put it in. So if you're doing logos
and you want to turn the logo into

120
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:04,719
and you want to turn the logo into
 

121
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,310
and you want to turn the logo into
particles, this is how you do it. Now

122
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:06,320
particles, this is how you do it. Now
 

123
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,150
particles, this is how you do it. Now
when it comes to getting the very first

124
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:08,160
when it comes to getting the very first
 

125
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,270
when it comes to getting the very first
steps of any particle system idea, you

126
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:11,280
steps of any particle system idea, you
 

127
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,790
steps of any particle system idea, you
do have to figure out what is the

128
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:12,800
do have to figure out what is the
 

129
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,030
do have to figure out what is the
initial shape we have to go with to go

130
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,040
initial shape we have to go with to go
 

131
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,350
initial shape we have to go with to go
in that direction. So for this example,

132
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:17,360
in that direction. So for this example,
 

133
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,869
in that direction. So for this example,
this animation kind of looks like a

134
00:02:18,869 --> 00:02:18,879
this animation kind of looks like a
 

135
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,949
this animation kind of looks like a
wreath. So the first thing I decided was

136
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:20,959
wreath. So the first thing I decided was
 

137
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,589
wreath. So the first thing I decided was
let's get a cylinder and uh distribute

138
00:02:23,589 --> 00:02:23,599
let's get a cylinder and uh distribute
 

139
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,309
let's get a cylinder and uh distribute
points on that cylinder and that will

140
00:02:26,309 --> 00:02:26,319
points on that cylinder and that will
 

141
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,470
points on that cylinder and that will
get us uh at the beginning of that then

142
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:28,480
get us uh at the beginning of that then
 

143
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,710
get us uh at the beginning of that then
I was able to later uh displace those

144
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:30,720
I was able to later uh displace those
 

145
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,550
I was able to later uh displace those
particles and get that more interesting

146
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:32,560
particles and get that more interesting
 

147
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,350
particles and get that more interesting
look. But I started with an initial uh

148
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:35,360
look. But I started with an initial uh
 

149
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,990
look. But I started with an initial uh
cylinder shape and distributed points on

150
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,000
cylinder shape and distributed points on
 

151
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,470
cylinder shape and distributed points on
it. Now with these animations that I

152
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:40,480
it. Now with these animations that I
 

153
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,750
it. Now with these animations that I
did, there was two ways that I

154
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:41,760
did, there was two ways that I
 

155
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,830
did, there was two ways that I
influenced the initial shape. So you can

156
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:43,840
influenced the initial shape. So you can
 

157
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,150
influenced the initial shape. So you can
place particles in or on some

158
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,160
place particles in or on some
 

159
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,509
place particles in or on some
predetermined shape like a circle, uh

160
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:49,519
predetermined shape like a circle, uh
 

161
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,150
predetermined shape like a circle, uh
flat plane, even text, logos, different

162
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:52,160
flat plane, even text, logos, different
 

163
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,470
flat plane, even text, logos, different
things like that. You can use that

164
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:54,480
things like that. You can use that
 

165
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,150
things like that. You can use that
initial shape and you can predetermine

166
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,160
initial shape and you can predetermine
 

167
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,309
initial shape and you can predetermine
that right there. Or you can use images

168
00:02:58,309 --> 00:02:58,319
that right there. Or you can use images
 

169
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,710
that right there. Or you can use images
and textures to delete particles that

170
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:00,720
and textures to delete particles that
 

171
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,509
and textures to delete particles that
will influence how they will show up and

172
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:03,519
will influence how they will show up and
 

173
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,589
will influence how they will show up and
create some type of initial shape. So

174
00:03:05,589 --> 00:03:05,599
create some type of initial shape. So
 

175
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,949
create some type of initial shape. So
that's typically one of the first things

176
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:06,959
that's typically one of the first things
 

177
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,149
that's typically one of the first things
you're going to want to be thinking

178
00:03:08,149 --> 00:03:08,159
you're going to want to be thinking
 

179
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,830
you're going to want to be thinking
about when trying to make something

180
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:09,840
about when trying to make something
 

181
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,750
about when trying to make something
cool. So, in terms of using textures and

182
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:11,760
cool. So, in terms of using textures and
 

183
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,589
cool. So, in terms of using textures and
images to delete things, both of these

184
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:13,599
images to delete things, both of these
 

185
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,589
images to delete things, both of these
animations are doing the exact same

186
00:03:15,589 --> 00:03:15,599
animations are doing the exact same
 

187
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,990
animations are doing the exact same
thing. Using images to delete points

188
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,000
thing. Using images to delete points
 

189
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,070
thing. Using images to delete points
that we can then later animate or do

190
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,080
that we can then later animate or do
 

191
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,309
that we can then later animate or do
something with. So, for example, I got a

192
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:22,319
something with. So, for example, I got a
 

193
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,790
something with. So, for example, I got a
cube and I just stretched it to be

194
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:24,800
cube and I just stretched it to be
 

195
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,350
cube and I just stretched it to be
basically the type of shape that I'm

196
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:27,360
basically the type of shape that I'm
 

197
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,710
basically the type of shape that I'm
wanting my particle system to be before

198
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:30,720
wanting my particle system to be before
 

199
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,750
wanting my particle system to be before
I start deleting points. And then again,

200
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:33,760
I start deleting points. And then again,
 

201
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,070
I start deleting points. And then again,
distributed those points within that

202
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:36,080
distributed those points within that
 

203
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,309
distributed those points within that
space. Once you have some kind of image

204
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:38,319
space. Once you have some kind of image
 

205
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,830
space. Once you have some kind of image
picked out, you'll get a delete

206
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:39,840
picked out, you'll get a delete
 

207
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,830
picked out, you'll get a delete
geometry. Get an image texture and open

208
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:41,840
geometry. Get an image texture and open
 

209
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,190
geometry. Get an image texture and open
up that image. Then you're going to need

210
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,200
up that image. Then you're going to need
 

211
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,710
up that image. Then you're going to need
some vector math and some position

212
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:44,720
some vector math and some position
 

213
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,390
some vector math and some position
information so that you can actually

214
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:46,400
information so that you can actually
 

215
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,910
information so that you can actually
move this thing around by adjusting the

216
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:49,920
move this thing around by adjusting the
 

217
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,789
move this thing around by adjusting the
X and the Y

218
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:52,799
X and the Y
 

219
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,430
X and the Y
of the text and then moving them around

220
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:55,440
of the text and then moving them around
 

221
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,470
of the text and then moving them around
with your ad. And that is how you can

222
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:58,480
with your ad. And that is how you can
 

223
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,670
with your ad. And that is how you can
get text to actually be deleting and

224
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:01,680
get text to actually be deleting and
 

225
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,509
get text to actually be deleting and
showing up. And then you can go after

226
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:03,519
showing up. And then you can go after
 

227
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,270
showing up. And then you can go after
that coloring and animating the points.

228
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:05,280
that coloring and animating the points.
 

229
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,270
that coloring and animating the points.
That is how we can actually delete

230
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:07,280
That is how we can actually delete
 

231
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,390
That is how we can actually delete
points using images, using textures, all

232
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:10,400
points using images, using textures, all
 

233
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,390
points using images, using textures, all
of that. And again, I did the exact same

234
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:12,400
of that. And again, I did the exact same
 

235
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,309
of that. And again, I did the exact same
thing with an image of a fingerprint.

236
00:04:14,309 --> 00:04:14,319
thing with an image of a fingerprint.
 

237
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,270
thing with an image of a fingerprint.
So, you can use any solid black and

238
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:17,280
So, you can use any solid black and
 

239
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,590
So, you can use any solid black and
white image to influence particles. One

240
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:19,600
white image to influence particles. One
 

241
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,110
white image to influence particles. One
other random way that I was able to

242
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,120
other random way that I was able to
 

243
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,950
other random way that I was able to
influence the shape of the particles in

244
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:22,960
influence the shape of the particles in
 

245
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,189
influence the shape of the particles in
this particular animation was I just

246
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:25,199
this particular animation was I just
 

247
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,430
this particular animation was I just
wanted no matter what the animation was,

248
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:27,440
wanted no matter what the animation was,
 

249
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,030
wanted no matter what the animation was,
I wanted to contain what you were seeing

250
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:29,040
I wanted to contain what you were seeing
 

251
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,510
I wanted to contain what you were seeing
within a sphere. So, it was simple. I

252
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:31,520
within a sphere. So, it was simple. I
 

253
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,590
within a sphere. So, it was simple. I
just was able to get a proximity system

254
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
just was able to get a proximity system
 

255
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,990
just was able to get a proximity system
to say once particles go out a certain

256
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,000
to say once particles go out a certain
 

257
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,710
to say once particles go out a certain
distance scale them out and after that

258
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:38,720
distance scale them out and after that
 

259
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,070
distance scale them out and after that
it made this really really cool

260
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,080
it made this really really cool
 

261
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,350
it made this really really cool
animation. So once you have some kind of

262
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,360
animation. So once you have some kind of
 

263
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,110
animation. So once you have some kind of
initial shape that you've decided for

264
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,120
initial shape that you've decided for
 

265
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,030
initial shape that you've decided for
your particle system now we can actually

266
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:47,040
your particle system now we can actually
 

267
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,550
your particle system now we can actually
get into animating them moving them

268
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:48,560
get into animating them moving them
 

269
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,150
get into animating them moving them
around with textures and different

270
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:50,160
around with textures and different
 

271
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,909
around with textures and different
things like that to make them look and

272
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:51,919
things like that to make them look and
 

273
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,430
things like that to make them look and
move in a really cool way. So let's do

274
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:53,440
move in a really cool way. So let's do
 

275
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,950
move in a really cool way. So let's do
that. I want to start out with in my

276
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:54,960
that. I want to start out with in my
 

277
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,110
that. I want to start out with in my
opinion the the coolest way that I've

278
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:57,120
opinion the the coolest way that I've
 

279
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,590
opinion the the coolest way that I've
recently found to animate particles. So,

280
00:04:59,590 --> 00:04:59,600
recently found to animate particles. So,
 

281
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,510
recently found to animate particles. So,
we just have a couple nodes putting

282
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:01,520
we just have a couple nodes putting
 

283
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,830
we just have a couple nodes putting
small particles in a system. Now, for

284
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:03,840
small particles in a system. Now, for
 

285
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,510
small particles in a system. Now, for
context, the way I've been animating

286
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:05,520
context, the way I've been animating
 

287
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,270
context, the way I've been animating
particles for a really long time was

288
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:07,280
particles for a really long time was
 

289
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,189
particles for a really long time was
getting the color into an offset and

290
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:09,199
getting the color into an offset and
 

291
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,909
getting the color into an offset and
then just getting a really small scale.

292
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:11,919
then just getting a really small scale.
 

293
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,990
then just getting a really small scale.
And then you can just play with the W.

294
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,000
And then you can just play with the W.
 

295
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,629
And then you can just play with the W.
And now we can actually move around and

296
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:16,639
And now we can actually move around and
 

297
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,350
And now we can actually move around and
animate particles just like this. You

298
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:19,360
animate particles just like this. You
 

299
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,070
animate particles just like this. You
can also get vector math to say how

300
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,080
can also get vector math to say how
 

301
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,670
can also get vector math to say how
strong do we want this effect to be. But

302
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:25,680
strong do we want this effect to be. But
 

303
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,749
strong do we want this effect to be. But
this is how I've been doing it from day

304
00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:27,759
this is how I've been doing it from day
 

305
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,510
this is how I've been doing it from day
one. animating particles and geometry

306
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:29,520
one. animating particles and geometry
 

307
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,749
one. animating particles and geometry
nodes. But now we have this new thing

308
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:31,759
nodes. But now we have this new thing
 

309
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,230
nodes. But now we have this new thing
called a repeat zone. And I've been

310
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:34,240
called a repeat zone. And I've been
 

311
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,590
called a repeat zone. And I've been
seeing this technique float around on

312
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:35,600
seeing this technique float around on
 

313
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,070
seeing this technique float around on
the internet. Uh Mantisa did a really

314
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,080
the internet. Uh Mantisa did a really
 

315
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,150
the internet. Uh Mantisa did a really
cool live stream on it. And there's a

316
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:40,160
cool live stream on it. And there's a
 

317
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,590
cool live stream on it. And there's a
lot of cool things we can do with this.

318
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:41,600
lot of cool things we can do with this.
 

319
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,430
lot of cool things we can do with this.
So So if you put the set position within

320
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:43,440
So So if you put the set position within
 

321
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,270
So So if you put the set position within
a repeat and then do that same thing

322
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:45,280
a repeat and then do that same thing
 

323
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,110
a repeat and then do that same thing
that we just did, I'm going to go ahead

324
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:47,120
that we just did, I'm going to go ahead
 

325
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,950
that we just did, I'm going to go ahead
bring my scale to be something very,

326
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:48,960
bring my scale to be something very,
 

327
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,310
bring my scale to be something very,
very small. And once we start to repeat

328
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:52,320
very small. And once we start to repeat
 

329
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,550
very small. And once we start to repeat
this, you get this very interesting

330
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:56,560
this, you get this very interesting
 

331
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,830
this, you get this very interesting
almost splashy looking texture that if

332
00:05:59,830 --> 00:05:59,840
almost splashy looking texture that if
 

333
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,710
almost splashy looking texture that if
we go ahead and play with the 4D, you

334
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:02,720
we go ahead and play with the 4D, you
 

335
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,870
we go ahead and play with the 4D, you
get something really really awesome. And

336
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:04,880
get something really really awesome. And
 

337
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,230
get something really really awesome. And
it is greatly affected by uh the scale

338
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,240
it is greatly affected by uh the scale
 

339
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,309
it is greatly affected by uh the scale
of your, you know, the vector scale that

340
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:10,319
of your, you know, the vector scale that
 

341
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,710
of your, you know, the vector scale that
we do and of course by the scale of the

342
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:12,720
we do and of course by the scale of the
 

343
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,590
we do and of course by the scale of the
texture. And we get something amazing.

344
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:15,600
texture. And we get something amazing.
 

345
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,350
texture. And we get something amazing.
If I bring down the scale of my points

346
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:17,360
If I bring down the scale of my points
 

347
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,510
If I bring down the scale of my points
and I just bring up the density of these

348
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:19,520
and I just bring up the density of these
 

349
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,070
and I just bring up the density of these
this animation, it just starts to look

350
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,080
this animation, it just starts to look
 

351
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,909
this animation, it just starts to look
absolutely incredible. We can bring up

352
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:23,919
absolutely incredible. We can bring up
 

353
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,749
absolutely incredible. We can bring up
the scale a little bit. If we bring down

354
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:25,759
the scale a little bit. If we bring down
 

355
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,350
the scale a little bit. If we bring down
the scale a little bit, gets it a little

356
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:27,360
the scale a little bit, gets it a little
 

357
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,990
the scale a little bit, gets it a little
bit more uh waterlike. Playing with the

358
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,000
bit more uh waterlike. Playing with the
 

359
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,309
bit more uh waterlike. Playing with the
W, playing with the scale. There's a ton

360
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:32,319
W, playing with the scale. There's a ton
 

361
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,510
W, playing with the scale. There's a ton
of things that you can do with this and

362
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:35,520
of things that you can do with this and
 

363
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,110
of things that you can do with this and
it just looks really really cool. So,

364
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:39,120
it just looks really really cool. So,
 

365
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,270
it just looks really really cool. So,
just repeating a noise texture get some

366
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,280
just repeating a noise texture get some
 

367
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,830
just repeating a noise texture get some
pretty insane particle uh textures. Now,

368
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:43,840
pretty insane particle uh textures. Now,
 

369
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,029
pretty insane particle uh textures. Now,
another thing we can do is if we have if

370
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:45,039
another thing we can do is if we have if
 

371
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,629
another thing we can do is if we have if
we have a noise texture at a really low

372
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:46,639
we have a noise texture at a really low
 

373
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,070
we have a noise texture at a really low
scale, just something like this. It's

374
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,080
scale, just something like this. It's
 

375
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,710
scale, just something like this. It's
kind of globby for whatever reason. This

376
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:50,720
kind of globby for whatever reason. This
 

377
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,350
kind of globby for whatever reason. This
is the animation and the shape you want

378
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:53,360
is the animation and the shape you want
 

379
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,510
is the animation and the shape you want
this to be. You can add a little bit of

380
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:55,520
this to be. You can add a little bit of
 

381
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,830
this to be. You can add a little bit of
detail by mixing another noise texture

382
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:57,840
detail by mixing another noise texture
 

383
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,909
detail by mixing another noise texture
with a mixed color. And then you can

384
00:06:59,909 --> 00:06:59,919
with a mixed color. And then you can
 

385
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,830
with a mixed color. And then you can
take one noise texture, scale it up

386
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:01,840
take one noise texture, scale it up
 

387
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,670
take one noise texture, scale it up
pretty significantly, bring it back to

388
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:03,680
pretty significantly, bring it back to
 

389
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,589
pretty significantly, bring it back to
the original shape. And if you just

390
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:05,599
the original shape. And if you just
 

391
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,510
the original shape. And if you just
bring that factor in, it's just going to

392
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:07,520
bring that factor in, it's just going to
 

393
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,749
bring that factor in, it's just going to
give it a little bit more of a

394
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:09,759
give it a little bit more of a
 

395
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,950
give it a little bit more of a
interesting higher detailed shape rather

396
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:12,960
interesting higher detailed shape rather
 

397
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,950
interesting higher detailed shape rather
than this.

398
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:14,960
than this.
 

399
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,110
than this.
You can actually bring up the detail to

400
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:17,120
You can actually bring up the detail to
 

401
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,270
You can actually bring up the detail to
something like that.

402
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:19,280
something like that.
 

403
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,510
something like that.
And you have a little bit more variation

404
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:21,520
And you have a little bit more variation
 

405
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,950
And you have a little bit more variation
and also another opportunity to animate

406
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:24,960
and also another opportunity to animate
 

407
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,870
and also another opportunity to animate
two different components of the noise

408
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:26,880
two different components of the noise
 

409
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,110
two different components of the noise
texture of the particle system. And it

410
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:29,120
texture of the particle system. And it
 

411
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,350
texture of the particle system. And it
gives you a lot of control and a way to

412
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:31,360
gives you a lot of control and a way to
 

413
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,110
gives you a lot of control and a way to
just make something even more

414
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:33,120
just make something even more
 

415
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,350
just make something even more
interesting. getting all the individual

416
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:35,360
interesting. getting all the individual
 

417
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,629
interesting. getting all the individual
particles to look like they're moving

418
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:36,639
particles to look like they're moving
 

419
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,629
particles to look like they're moving
and the larger uh scene as well. One

420
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:40,639
and the larger uh scene as well. One
 

421
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,629
and the larger uh scene as well. One
more problem you might run into with

422
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:42,639
more problem you might run into with
 

423
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,629
more problem you might run into with
animating particles is you're animating

424
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:44,639
animating particles is you're animating
 

425
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,589
animating particles is you're animating
these particles at a really low scale

426
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:47,599
these particles at a really low scale
 

427
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,629
these particles at a really low scale
right here. It's 009 and all all the

428
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:50,639
right here. It's 009 and all all the
 

429
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,990
right here. It's 009 and all all the
particles are just kind of moving

430
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:52,000
particles are just kind of moving
 

431
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,550
particles are just kind of moving
together like a like a really close

432
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:54,560
together like a like a really close
 

433
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,550
together like a like a really close
together school of fish. See how that

434
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:56,560
together school of fish. See how that
 

435
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,749
together school of fish. See how that
looks? And we can just bring up that

436
00:07:57,749 --> 00:07:57,759
looks? And we can just bring up that
 

437
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,749
looks? And we can just bring up that
scale a little bit. You get the idea

438
00:07:59,749 --> 00:07:59,759
scale a little bit. You get the idea
 

439
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,270
scale a little bit. You get the idea
that all the particles don't look like

440
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:01,280
that all the particles don't look like
 

441
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,629
that all the particles don't look like
they have a mind of their own. They're

442
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:02,639
they have a mind of their own. They're
 

443
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,430
they have a mind of their own. They're
all moving kind of with the same mind

444
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:05,440
all moving kind of with the same mind
 

445
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,869
all moving kind of with the same mind
essentially. And I'm calling the mind

446
00:08:06,869 --> 00:08:06,879
essentially. And I'm calling the mind
 

447
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,749
essentially. And I'm calling the mind
the W. They're all moving from the same

448
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:09,759
the W. They're all moving from the same
 

449
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,950
the W. They're all moving from the same
W value. I want them to have their own

450
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:12,960
W value. I want them to have their own
 

451
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,869
W value. I want them to have their own
mind. What could I do? I can bring up

452
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:14,879
mind. What could I do? I can bring up
 

453
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,430
mind. What could I do? I can bring up
the scale, right? Maybe something pretty

454
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:17,440
the scale, right? Maybe something pretty
 

455
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,189
the scale, right? Maybe something pretty
big so that it doesn't look like they're

456
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:19,199
big so that it doesn't look like they're
 

457
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,430
big so that it doesn't look like they're
all dealing with the same texture. Um,

458
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:21,440
all dealing with the same texture. Um,
 

459
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,950
all dealing with the same texture. Um,
then this W value gets very very

460
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:24,960
then this W value gets very very
 

461
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,749
then this W value gets very very
sensitive. I mean you can look but at a

462
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:27,759
sensitive. I mean you can look but at a
 

463
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,430
sensitive. I mean you can look but at a
smaller value like three the the W is a

464
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:31,440
smaller value like three the the W is a
 

465
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,230
smaller value like three the the W is a
is far more controlled. You can animate

466
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:34,240
is far more controlled. You can animate
 

467
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,029
is far more controlled. You can animate
it better but again all the points just

468
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:37,039
it better but again all the points just
 

469
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,230
it better but again all the points just
look like they're moving together. How

470
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:38,240
look like they're moving together. How
 

471
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,310
look like they're moving together. How
can we fix that? So before the set

472
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:40,320
can we fix that? So before the set
 

473
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,990
can we fix that? So before the set
position you can get a store named

474
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:42,000
position you can get a store named
 

475
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,949
position you can get a store named
attribute a random value node and we'll

476
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:44,959
attribute a random value node and we'll
 

477
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,790
attribute a random value node and we'll
just plug that value into value and just

478
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:46,800
just plug that value into value and just
 

479
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,949
just plug that value into value and just
call it R. Now we can get a named

480
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:48,959
call it R. Now we can get a named
 

481
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,829
call it R. Now we can get a named
attribute node. Call that and then plug

482
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:51,839
attribute node. Call that and then plug
 

483
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,470
attribute node. Call that and then plug
attribute right into the W because again

484
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:54,480
attribute right into the W because again
 

485
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,150
attribute right into the W because again
the problem is they're all animating

486
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:56,160
the problem is they're all animating
 

487
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,070
the problem is they're all animating
from the same W value. Now we're going

488
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,080
from the same W value. Now we're going
 

489
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,670
from the same W value. Now we're going
to randomize the W value per point. Now

490
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:01,680
to randomize the W value per point. Now
 

491
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,430
to randomize the W value per point. Now
we'll get a math node and set it to

492
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:03,440
we'll get a math node and set it to
 

493
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,110
we'll get a math node and set it to
multiply add. This add right here is the

494
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,120
multiply add. This add right here is the
 

495
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,430
multiply add. This add right here is the
W value. It's just now we have access to

496
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:09,440
W value. It's just now we have access to
 

497
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,550
W value. It's just now we have access to
it through the addendant and the

498
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:10,560
it through the addendant and the
 

499
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,550
it through the addendant and the
multiplier is just going to strengthen

500
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:12,560
multiplier is just going to strengthen
 

501
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,230
multiplier is just going to strengthen
that effect per point. And now all of

502
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:16,240
that effect per point. And now all of
 

503
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,389
that effect per point. And now all of
the objects are still animating from a

504
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:18,399
the objects are still animating from a
 

505
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,750
the objects are still animating from a
very small noise texture scale, but they

506
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:21,760
very small noise texture scale, but they
 

507
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,829
very small noise texture scale, but they
all are doing their own thing. And

508
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:23,839
all are doing their own thing. And
 

509
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,750
all are doing their own thing. And
again, this add is the W. So if you know

510
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:25,760
again, this add is the W. So if you know
 

511
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,070
again, this add is the W. So if you know
how to loop the W, just do it right

512
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,080
how to loop the W, just do it right
 

513
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,550
how to loop the W, just do it right
here. And then now you have a collection

514
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:30,560
here. And then now you have a collection
 

515
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,509
here. And then now you have a collection
of points that are at a low scale value,

516
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:33,519
of points that are at a low scale value,
 

517
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,509
of points that are at a low scale value,
but all have a mind of their own. This

518
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:35,519
but all have a mind of their own. This
 

519
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,590
but all have a mind of their own. This
was one of my favorite animations I did.

520
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:37,600
was one of my favorite animations I did.
 

521
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,870
was one of my favorite animations I did.
And it really has this incredible nebula

522
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:40,880
And it really has this incredible nebula
 

523
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,550
And it really has this incredible nebula
look. So, the way I was able to set that

524
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:42,560
look. So, the way I was able to set that
 

525
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,710
look. So, the way I was able to set that
up was again using that cylinder like I

526
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:44,720
up was again using that cylinder like I
 

527
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,230
up was again using that cylinder like I
mentioned, getting a bunch of particles

528
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,240
mentioned, getting a bunch of particles
 

529
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,310
mentioned, getting a bunch of particles
and then displacing them using that

530
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:48,320
and then displacing them using that
 

531
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,550
and then displacing them using that
repeat zone trick, but instead of

532
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:50,560
repeat zone trick, but instead of
 

533
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,870
repeat zone trick, but instead of
animating the particles with the W

534
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:52,880
animating the particles with the W
 

535
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,670
animating the particles with the W
value, I just created that vector math

536
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:55,680
value, I just created that vector math
 

537
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,350
value, I just created that vector math
kind of mapping setup and then I

538
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:57,360
kind of mapping setup and then I
 

539
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,430
kind of mapping setup and then I
actually rotated the texture. So, as

540
00:09:59,430 --> 00:09:59,440
actually rotated the texture. So, as
 

541
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,750
actually rotated the texture. So, as
that texture is slowly rotating, those

542
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:01,760
that texture is slowly rotating, those
 

543
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,230
that texture is slowly rotating, those
particles are technically not moving

544
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:04,240
particles are technically not moving
 

545
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,030
particles are technically not moving
from a set position standpoint. They're

546
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,040
from a set position standpoint. They're
 

547
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,269
from a set position standpoint. They're
just being affected by the fact that

548
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:09,279
just being affected by the fact that
 

549
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,110
just being affected by the fact that
that texture is moving and they're kind

550
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:11,120
that texture is moving and they're kind
 

551
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,190
that texture is moving and they're kind
of moving like it's water. This really

552
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:13,200
of moving like it's water. This really
 

553
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,110
of moving like it's water. This really
cool nebula look. So instead of

554
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:15,120
cool nebula look. So instead of
 

555
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,990
cool nebula look. So instead of
animating the W, maybe try rotating the

556
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:18,000
animating the W, maybe try rotating the
 

557
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,470
animating the W, maybe try rotating the
texture of the noise and seeing how

558
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:20,480
texture of the noise and seeing how
 

559
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,990
texture of the noise and seeing how
those particles react. So you can

560
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:22,000
those particles react. So you can
 

561
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,150
those particles react. So you can
animate the W. You can also animate the

562
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:24,160
animate the W. You can also animate the
 

563
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,790
animate the W. You can also animate the
rotation as another way to get some

564
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:26,800
rotation as another way to get some
 

565
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,949
rotation as another way to get some
really cool motion. All right. As a

566
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:28,959
really cool motion. All right. As a
 

567
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,030
really cool motion. All right. As a
beginner, I think lighting particles is

568
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,040
beginner, I think lighting particles is
 

569
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,190
beginner, I think lighting particles is
incredibly frustrating. I'm typically

570
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:33,200
incredibly frustrating. I'm typically
 

571
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,430
incredibly frustrating. I'm typically
finding myself in two different uh kind

572
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:35,440
finding myself in two different uh kind
 

573
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,190
finding myself in two different uh kind
of lighting environments. This kind of

574
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:37,200
of lighting environments. This kind of
 

575
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,350
of lighting environments. This kind of
low light, very high contrast

576
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:39,360
low light, very high contrast
 

577
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,269
low light, very high contrast
environment or a much brighter

578
00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:41,279
environment or a much brighter
 

579
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,949
environment or a much brighter
environment that's a little bit more

580
00:10:42,949 --> 00:10:42,959
environment that's a little bit more
 

581
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,389
environment that's a little bit more
delicate when it comes to how we're

582
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:44,399
delicate when it comes to how we're
 

583
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,710
delicate when it comes to how we're
placing lights. Now, in either of these

584
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:46,720
placing lights. Now, in either of these
 

585
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,630
placing lights. Now, in either of these
two environments, the biggest thing that

586
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:48,640
two environments, the biggest thing that
 

587
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,790
two environments, the biggest thing that
is going to affect how professional or

588
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:50,800
is going to affect how professional or
 

589
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,790
is going to affect how professional or
how good it's going to look is just

590
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:52,800
how good it's going to look is just
 

591
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,870
how good it's going to look is just
having more particles, especially if the

592
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:54,880
having more particles, especially if the
 

593
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,030
having more particles, especially if the
particles are small. I found myself

594
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,040
particles are small. I found myself
 

595
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,949
particles are small. I found myself
bringing my density up to a point where

596
00:10:58,949 --> 00:10:58,959
bringing my density up to a point where
 

597
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,190
bringing my density up to a point where
it almost felt like it was a solid

598
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:01,200
it almost felt like it was a solid
 

599
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,430
it almost felt like it was a solid
object. And at that point, that's when

600
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:03,440
object. And at that point, that's when
 

601
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,190
object. And at that point, that's when
the lighting started to work in my

602
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:05,200
the lighting started to work in my
 

603
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,190
the lighting started to work in my
favor. If you have too few particles,

604
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:07,200
favor. If you have too few particles,
 

605
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,550
favor. If you have too few particles,
the light is just going to go straight

606
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:08,560
the light is just going to go straight
 

607
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,670
the light is just going to go straight
through it. It's not going to be dense

608
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:09,680
through it. It's not going to be dense
 

609
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,790
through it. It's not going to be dense
enough, and it's really not going to be

610
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:10,800
enough, and it's really not going to be
 

611
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,790
enough, and it's really not going to be
readable, and the lighting is really

612
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:12,800
readable, and the lighting is really
 

613
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,470
readable, and the lighting is really
going to struggle. So, sometimes the

614
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:14,480
going to struggle. So, sometimes the
 

615
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,630
going to struggle. So, sometimes the
answer is simple as bring up your

616
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:16,640
answer is simple as bring up your
 

617
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,389
answer is simple as bring up your
density of the particles. I know it's

618
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:18,399
density of the particles. I know it's
 

619
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,230
density of the particles. I know it's
very computer inensive. Just figure out

620
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:20,240
very computer inensive. Just figure out
 

621
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,430
very computer inensive. Just figure out
what number that looks like, and then

622
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:21,440
what number that looks like, and then
 

623
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,870
what number that looks like, and then
when you're ready to render, bring it up

624
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:22,880
when you're ready to render, bring it up
 

625
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,150
when you're ready to render, bring it up
to that number, render out your

626
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:24,160
to that number, render out your
 

627
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,990
to that number, render out your
animation. So, I'll give you an example.

628
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:26,000
animation. So, I'll give you an example.
 

629
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,990
animation. So, I'll give you an example.
In this scene right here, there was

630
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,000
In this scene right here, there was
 

631
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,230
In this scene right here, there was
three lights. I took my background far

632
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:30,240
three lights. I took my background far
 

633
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,230
three lights. I took my background far
back enough to where the area lights

634
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:32,240
back enough to where the area lights
 

635
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,990
back enough to where the area lights
that were going to hit the particles

636
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,000
that were going to hit the particles
 

637
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,509
that were going to hit the particles
weren't hitting my background. And I was

638
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:35,519
weren't hitting my background. And I was
 

639
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,870
weren't hitting my background. And I was
able to control the background

640
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:36,880
able to control the background
 

641
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,110
able to control the background
independently. Then I was able to get a

642
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:39,120
independently. Then I was able to get a
 

643
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,110
independently. Then I was able to get a
light above it and then a light at the

644
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:41,120
light above it and then a light at the
 

645
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,949
light above it and then a light at the
very back hitting the back of it to get

646
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:42,959
very back hitting the back of it to get
 

647
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,110
very back hitting the back of it to get
it this really nice studio effect where

648
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:45,120
it this really nice studio effect where
 

649
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,190
it this really nice studio effect where
my background had its own control

650
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:47,200
my background had its own control
 

651
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,550
my background had its own control
independently to make it look really

652
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:48,560
independently to make it look really
 

653
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,509
independently to make it look really
beautiful. And then two points at the

654
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:51,519
beautiful. And then two points at the
 

655
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,829
beautiful. And then two points at the
top and the back to make it look really,

656
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:53,839
top and the back to make it look really,
 

657
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,829
top and the back to make it look really,
really nice. Now, of course, sometimes

658
00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:55,839
really nice. Now, of course, sometimes
 

659
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,590
really nice. Now, of course, sometimes
the lighting comes from the particles

660
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:57,600
the lighting comes from the particles
 

661
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,430
the lighting comes from the particles
themselves because the particles are

662
00:11:59,430 --> 00:11:59,440
themselves because the particles are
 

663
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,150
themselves because the particles are
emissive. So, in that case, lighting

664
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:02,160
emissive. So, in that case, lighting
 

665
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,910
emissive. So, in that case, lighting
isn't really going to affect it, and you

666
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:03,920
isn't really going to affect it, and you
 

667
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,990
isn't really going to affect it, and you
can get away with lower densities

668
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:06,000
can get away with lower densities
 

669
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,430
can get away with lower densities
because things are a little bit easier

670
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:07,440
because things are a little bit easier
 

671
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,190
because things are a little bit easier
to read. All right, now let's talk about

672
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:09,200
to read. All right, now let's talk about
 

673
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,389
to read. All right, now let's talk about
shading and shaping these particles so

674
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:12,399
shading and shaping these particles so
 

675
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,829
shading and shaping these particles so
they can look really cool. Now, most of

676
00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:13,839
they can look really cool. Now, most of
 

677
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,069
they can look really cool. Now, most of
the time, I'm just using the default

678
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:16,079
the time, I'm just using the default
 

679
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,910
the time, I'm just using the default
spherical points that happen when you

680
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:17,920
spherical points that happen when you
 

681
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,150
spherical points that happen when you
just simply add points. Now, one trick

682
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:20,160
just simply add points. Now, one trick
 

683
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,470
just simply add points. Now, one trick
I've recently used is separating some of

684
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:22,480
I've recently used is separating some of
 

685
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,870
I've recently used is separating some of
the objects and replacing them with this

686
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:24,880
the objects and replacing them with this
 

687
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,269
the objects and replacing them with this
flat circle that has a really reflective

688
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:27,279
flat circle that has a really reflective
 

689
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,430
flat circle that has a really reflective
metallic material. That's going to

690
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:29,440
metallic material. That's going to
 

691
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,670
metallic material. That's going to
create these really reflective moments

692
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:31,680
create these really reflective moments
 

693
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,590
create these really reflective moments
that add just this really nice interest

694
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:33,600
that add just this really nice interest
 

695
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,990
that add just this really nice interest
to your animation. So, you don't always

696
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:36,000
to your animation. So, you don't always
 

697
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,310
to your animation. So, you don't always
have to stick with the default spheres.

698
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:38,320
have to stick with the default spheres.
 

699
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,910
have to stick with the default spheres.
Another really easy way to add some

700
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:39,920
Another really easy way to add some
 

701
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,350
Another really easy way to add some
interest in your animation is just

702
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:41,360
interest in your animation is just
 

703
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,150
interest in your animation is just
simply randomizing the size of the

704
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,160
simply randomizing the size of the
 

705
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,710
simply randomizing the size of the
points. Then, what you can do is set up

706
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:46,720
points. Then, what you can do is set up
 

707
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,190
points. Then, what you can do is set up
a store named attribute. plug that same

708
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:49,200
a store named attribute. plug that same
 

709
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,190
a store named attribute. plug that same
randomization into the attribute. You

710
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:51,200
randomization into the attribute. You
 

711
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,870
randomization into the attribute. You
can go to the shading, call that

712
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:52,880
can go to the shading, call that
 

713
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,069
can go to the shading, call that
attribute and plug that into the shading

714
00:12:56,069 --> 00:12:56,079
attribute and plug that into the shading
 

715
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,470
attribute and plug that into the shading
so that you can also get random color in

716
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:58,480
so that you can also get random color in
 

717
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,710
so that you can also get random color in
your animations and they stay put when

718
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:00,720
your animations and they stay put when
 

719
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,790
your animations and they stay put when
the particles are moving around, which I

720
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:02,800
the particles are moving around, which I
 

721
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,550
the particles are moving around, which I
think is really important. Now, using

722
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:04,560
think is really important. Now, using
 

723
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,389
think is really important. Now, using
that same idea of taking something in

724
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:06,399
that same idea of taking something in
 

725
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,230
that same idea of taking something in
geometry nodes, plugging it into a store

726
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:08,240
geometry nodes, plugging it into a store
 

727
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,750
geometry nodes, plugging it into a store
named attribute, you can actually take

728
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:09,760
named attribute, you can actually take
 

729
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,150
named attribute, you can actually take
the same noise texture that is operating

730
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,160
the same noise texture that is operating
 

731
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,550
the same noise texture that is operating
some movements in geometry nodes, and

732
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:14,560
some movements in geometry nodes, and
 

733
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,629
some movements in geometry nodes, and
you can send that into the shading and

734
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:16,639
you can send that into the shading and
 

735
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,030
you can send that into the shading and
use that to texture the points as well.

736
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:19,040
use that to texture the points as well.
 

737
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,509
use that to texture the points as well.
I was actually able to take that idea

738
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:21,519
I was actually able to take that idea
 

739
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,150
I was actually able to take that idea
and plug that texture into some of the

740
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:24,160
and plug that texture into some of the
 

741
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,389
and plug that texture into some of the
brightness of those particles in this

742
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:26,399
brightness of those particles in this
 

743
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,310
brightness of those particles in this
animation, and I just think it made it

744
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:28,320
animation, and I just think it made it
 

745
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,150
animation, and I just think it made it
look much, much cooler. So, there you

746
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:30,160
look much, much cooler. So, there you
 

747
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,750
look much, much cooler. So, there you
go. Those are all of my tips and tricks

748
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:31,760
go. Those are all of my tips and tricks
 

749
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,310
go. Those are all of my tips and tricks
that I dove into this week to make some

750
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:34,320
that I dove into this week to make some
 

751
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,990
that I dove into this week to make some
really cool animations. Again, if you
