00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,270

How's it going, guys? So, in this

2
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:01,280
How's it going, guys? So, in this
 

3
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,710
How's it going, guys? So, in this
tutorial, we are going to be creating

4
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:02,720
tutorial, we are going to be creating
 

5
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,269
tutorial, we are going to be creating
this animation right here from start to

6
00:00:05,269 --> 00:00:05,279
this animation right here from start to
 

7
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:06,710
this animation right here from start to
finish. It's going to be really fun.

8
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:06,720
finish. It's going to be really fun.
 

9
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,909
finish. It's going to be really fun.
This is all going to be done in the

10
00:00:07,909 --> 00:00:07,919
This is all going to be done in the
 

11
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,669
This is all going to be done in the
shading. So, we're going to start off

12
00:00:09,669 --> 00:00:09,679
shading. So, we're going to start off
 

13
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,910
shading. So, we're going to start off
with creating a really highly detailed,

14
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:11,920
with creating a really highly detailed,
 

15
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,910
with creating a really highly detailed,
almost woodlike looking pattern. Then,

16
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:13,920
almost woodlike looking pattern. Then,
 

17
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,350
almost woodlike looking pattern. Then,
we're going to use some masking to cut

18
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:15,360
we're going to use some masking to cut
 

19
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,870
we're going to use some masking to cut
out some of that shape so we can start

20
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:16,880
out some of that shape so we can start
 

21
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,310
out some of that shape so we can start
making some stuff that looks kind of

22
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:18,320
making some stuff that looks kind of
 

23
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,990
making some stuff that looks kind of
like a river. Then, we're going to use

24
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:20,000
like a river. Then, we're going to use
 

25
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,910
like a river. Then, we're going to use
some more shading tricks to take some of

26
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:21,920
some more shading tricks to take some of
 

27
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,509
some more shading tricks to take some of
those patterns and highlight them to

28
00:00:23,509 --> 00:00:23,519
those patterns and highlight them to
 

29
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,109
those patterns and highlight them to
make them brighter so that they will

30
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:25,119
make them brighter so that they will
 

31
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:26,710
make them brighter so that they will
glow and the other ones won't glow.

32
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:26,720
glow and the other ones won't glow.
 

33
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,390
glow and the other ones won't glow.
After that, to create that topographic

34
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:28,400
After that, to create that topographic
 

35
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,070
After that, to create that topographic
map inspiration, we are going to be

36
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:30,080
map inspiration, we are going to be
 

37
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,389
map inspiration, we are going to be
creating a grid floor for the bottom.

38
00:00:32,389 --> 00:00:32,399
creating a grid floor for the bottom.
 

39
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,830
creating a grid floor for the bottom.
Then all we're going to have to do is

40
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:33,840
Then all we're going to have to do is
 

41
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,990
Then all we're going to have to do is
animate the pattern, animate the camera,

42
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:36,000
animate the pattern, animate the camera,
 

43
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,229
animate the pattern, animate the camera,
and will be completely finished. This

44
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:38,239
and will be completely finished. This
 

45
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,750
and will be completely finished. This
animation is part of a series of

46
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:39,760
animation is part of a series of
 

47
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,510

that being said, let's get into this
 

99
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,630
that being said, let's get into this
tutorial. All right, all of this is

100
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:28,640
tutorial. All right, all of this is
 

101
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,870
tutorial. All right, all of this is
going to be done in uh the shading. So,

102
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:30,880
going to be done in uh the shading. So,
 

103
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,749
going to be done in uh the shading. So,
what we're going to do is I'm going hit

104
00:01:31,749 --> 00:01:31,759
what we're going to do is I'm going hit
 

105
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,510
what we're going to do is I'm going hit
shift A, get a plane. I'm going to hit

106
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:33,520
shift A, get a plane. I'm going to hit
 

107
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,310
shift A, get a plane. I'm going to hit
S10,

108
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:36,320
S10,
 

109
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,749
S10,
control A, apply that scale, and then

110
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:39,759
control A, apply that scale, and then
 

111
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,350
control A, apply that scale, and then
I'm just going to go ahead and get a

112
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:41,360
I'm just going to go ahead and get a
 

113
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,510
I'm just going to go ahead and get a
brand new window. This is going to be

114
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:43,520
brand new window. This is going to be
 

115
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,069
brand new window. This is going to be
the 3D viewport. This is going to be the

116
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:46,079
the 3D viewport. This is going to be the
 

117
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,069
the 3D viewport. This is going to be the
shader editor. I'm gonna hit N just to

118
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:48,079
shader editor. I'm gonna hit N just to
 

119
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,389
shader editor. I'm gonna hit N just to
move that. I'm click new. And then right

120
00:01:50,389 --> 00:01:50,399
move that. I'm click new. And then right
 

121
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:51,510
move that. I'm click new. And then right
over here, we're going to go here to

122
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:51,520
over here, we're going to go here to
 

123
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,670
over here, we're going to go here to
Eevee. I'm gonna scroll. I'm gonna click

124
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:53,680
Eevee. I'm gonna scroll. I'm gonna click
 

125
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,469
Eevee. I'm gonna scroll. I'm gonna click
on the material settings. And uh I'm

126
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:56,479
on the material settings. And uh I'm
 

127
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,469
on the material settings. And uh I'm
going to go here from dithered to

128
00:01:58,469 --> 00:01:58,479
going to go here from dithered to
 

129
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,270
going to go here from dithered to
blended. Make sure you do have a

130
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:01,280
blended. Make sure you do have a
 

131
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,670
blended. Make sure you do have a
material. And then that is going to keep

132
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:03,680
material. And then that is going to keep
 

133
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,830
material. And then that is going to keep
you from having grainy transparency. And

134
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:05,840
you from having grainy transparency. And
 

135
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,030
you from having grainy transparency. And
then we're just going to go here to the

136
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,040
then we're just going to go here to the
 

137
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,309
then we're just going to go here to the
EV view. And then in the uh compositing

138
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:10,319
EV view. And then in the uh compositing
 

139
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:11,589
EV view. And then in the uh compositing
tab up here, I'm going to click use

140
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:11,599
tab up here, I'm going to click use
 

141
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,390
tab up here, I'm going to click use
nodes. I'm going to type in glare and

142
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:14,400
nodes. I'm going to type in glare and
 

143
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,949
nodes. I'm going to type in glare and
switch this over to fog glow. So, we'll

144
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:16,959
switch this over to fog glow. So, we'll
 

145
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,949
switch this over to fog glow. So, we'll
go back to layout and now we can start.

146
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:18,959
go back to layout and now we can start.
 

147
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,790
go back to layout and now we can start.
So, here on the emission, let's give it

148
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:20,800
So, here on the emission, let's give it
 

149
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,550
So, here on the emission, let's give it
a strength of three for now so we can

150
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:22,560
a strength of three for now so we can
 

151
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,430
a strength of three for now so we can
see what's happening. And then I'm going

152
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:25,440
see what's happening. And then I'm going
 

153
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,190
see what's happening. And then I'm going
to hit this drop down right up here and

154
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:27,200
to hit this drop down right up here and
 

155
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,030
to hit this drop down right up here and
click on always. That's going to turn on

156
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,040
click on always. That's going to turn on
 

157
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,589
click on always. That's going to turn on
all of our compositing. So, world

158
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:31,599
all of our compositing. So, world
 

159
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,350
all of our compositing. So, world
brightness, we'll bring that down to

160
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:33,360
brightness, we'll bring that down to
 

161
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,150
brightness, we'll bring that down to
black. Let's get a color ramp and let's

162
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,160
black. Let's get a color ramp and let's
 

163
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,030
black. Let's get a color ramp and let's
plug that color ramp into the color and

164
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,040
plug that color ramp into the color and
 

165
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,270
plug that color ramp into the color and
pick our final output color. something

166
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:41,280
pick our final output color. something
 

167
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,750
pick our final output color. something
like a nice light blue. Something like

168
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:43,760
like a nice light blue. Something like
 

169
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,110
like a nice light blue. Something like
this. Then what I'm going to do is I'm

170
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:45,120
this. Then what I'm going to do is I'm
 

171
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,670
this. Then what I'm going to do is I'm
going to get a mix color. Plug this

172
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:47,680
going to get a mix color. Plug this
 

173
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,270
going to get a mix color. Plug this
here.

174
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:49,280
here.
 

175
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,390
here.
I'm going to make B black. And this is

176
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:52,400
I'm going to make B black. And this is
 

177
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,509
I'm going to make B black. And this is
just for some things that we're going to

178
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:53,519
just for some things that we're going to
 

179
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,589
just for some things that we're going to
need to do later. So let's go ahead and

180
00:02:55,589 --> 00:02:55,599
need to do later. So let's go ahead and
 

181
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,309
need to do later. So let's go ahead and
plug a color ramp into A. So if we bring

182
00:03:00,309 --> 00:03:00,319
plug a color ramp into A. So if we bring
 

183
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,750
plug a color ramp into A. So if we bring
factor over to the right, that's just

184
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:01,760
factor over to the right, that's just
 

185
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,229
factor over to the right, that's just
the black. Factor over to the B, that is

186
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:04,239
the black. Factor over to the B, that is
 

187
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,869
the black. Factor over to the B, that is
this color ramp. And let's go ahead and

188
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:06,879
this color ramp. And let's go ahead and
 

189
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,229
this color ramp. And let's go ahead and
add in our textures. So let's get a

190
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:08,239
add in our textures. So let's get a
 

191
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,309
add in our textures. So let's get a
noise texture.

192
00:03:10,309 --> 00:03:10,319
noise texture.
 

193
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,390
noise texture.
And let's get in a wave texture.

194
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:14,400
And let's get in a wave texture.
 

195
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,910
And let's get in a wave texture.
Plug that in the vector. And then I'm

196
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:15,920
Plug that in the vector. And then I'm
 

197
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,830
Plug that in the vector. And then I'm
going to hit controlT. If you have the

198
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:17,840
going to hit controlT. If you have the
 

199
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,750
going to hit controlT. If you have the
node wrangler add-on enabled, that's

200
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:19,760
node wrangler add-on enabled, that's
 

201
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,509
node wrangler add-on enabled, that's
that comes with Blender by default.

202
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:21,519
that comes with Blender by default.
 

203
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,110
that comes with Blender by default.
You'll just hit control T or just go

204
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,120
You'll just hit control T or just go
 

205
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,869
You'll just hit control T or just go
ahead and get a mapping node, a texture

206
00:03:24,869 --> 00:03:24,879
ahead and get a mapping node, a texture
 

207
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,390
ahead and get a mapping node, a texture
coordinate, and use the object

208
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:26,400
coordinate, and use the object
 

209
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,190
coordinate, and use the object
coordinate. So, let's go ahead and focus

210
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:29,200
coordinate. So, let's go ahead and focus
 

211
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,430
coordinate. So, let's go ahead and focus
on these guys. So, here on the scale of

212
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:31,440
on these guys. So, here on the scale of
 

213
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,110
on these guys. So, here on the scale of
the noise, don't worry about that. Bring

214
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:33,120
the noise, don't worry about that. Bring
 

215
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,869
the noise, don't worry about that. Bring
the scale of the wave texture really

216
00:03:34,869 --> 00:03:34,879
the scale of the wave texture really
 

217
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,630
the scale of the wave texture really
low. I found 0.5 looks really good. And

218
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:38,640
low. I found 0.5 looks really good. And
 

219
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,390
low. I found 0.5 looks really good. And
if you bring this in, you'll notice some

220
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:40,400
if you bring this in, you'll notice some
 

221
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,710
if you bring this in, you'll notice some
things changing. We now have this. If

222
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:42,720
things changing. We now have this. If
 

223
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,470
things changing. We now have this. If
you bring up the scale of the noise,

224
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:44,480
you bring up the scale of the noise,
 

225
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,229
you bring up the scale of the noise,
it's going to add more detail here, but

226
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:46,239
it's going to add more detail here, but
 

227
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,750
it's going to add more detail here, but
we'll that'll be more obvious in a

228
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:47,760
we'll that'll be more obvious in a
 

229
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,670
we'll that'll be more obvious in a
second. Let's bring our distortion

230
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:49,680
second. Let's bring our distortion
 

231
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,070
second. Let's bring our distortion
really really high. And then our detail

232
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:52,080
really really high. And then our detail
 

233
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,509
really really high. And then our detail
scale high as well.

234
00:03:55,509 --> 00:03:55,519
scale high as well.
 

235
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,910
scale high as well.
Something like three or four. And then

236
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:57,920
Something like three or four. And then
 

237
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,309
Something like three or four. And then
our detail. Once we bring up the detail,

238
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:00,319
our detail. Once we bring up the detail,
 

239
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,830
our detail. Once we bring up the detail,
we'll start to get kind of look like

240
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:01,840
we'll start to get kind of look like
 

241
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,949
we'll start to get kind of look like
what uh looks like wood.

242
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:04,959
what uh looks like wood.
 

243
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,030
what uh looks like wood.
So bring our detail to maybe 10. And

244
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,040
So bring our detail to maybe 10. And
 

245
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,589
So bring our detail to maybe 10. And
also I'm gonna switch from sign to saw.

246
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:09,599
also I'm gonna switch from sign to saw.
 

247
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,789
also I'm gonna switch from sign to saw.
That's just going to change it up a

248
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:10,799
That's just going to change it up a
 

249
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,390
That's just going to change it up a
little bit. So now we have this. If we

250
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:12,400
little bit. So now we have this. If we
 

251
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,149
little bit. So now we have this. If we
play with the phase offset, we get this

252
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:14,159
play with the phase offset, we get this
 

253
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,629
play with the phase offset, we get this
really cool looking thing. What I want

254
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:16,639
really cool looking thing. What I want
 

255
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,550
really cool looking thing. What I want
is this amount of detail. And again, if

256
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:18,560
is this amount of detail. And again, if
 

257
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,629
is this amount of detail. And again, if
you play with the noise texture, you

258
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:20,639
you play with the noise texture, you
 

259
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,150
you play with the noise texture, you
just add more and more detail into this.

260
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:24,160
just add more and more detail into this.
 

261
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,909
just add more and more detail into this.
So play around with that. See what you

262
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:25,919
So play around with that. See what you
 

263
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,629
So play around with that. See what you
like. I ended up settling around 13 for

264
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:28,639
like. I ended up settling around 13 for
 

265
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,110
like. I ended up settling around 13 for
my detail. Now, the reason why we added

266
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:31,120
my detail. Now, the reason why we added
 

267
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,950
my detail. Now, the reason why we added
this mix color rather than just maybe

268
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:34,960
this mix color rather than just maybe
 

269
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,070
this mix color rather than just maybe
throwing it in like that and doing this

270
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,080
throwing it in like that and doing this
 

271
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,110
throwing it in like that and doing this
is we need this color ramp to control

272
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,120
is we need this color ramp to control
 

273
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,430
is we need this color ramp to control
these textures here. So, we can leave it

274
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:43,440
these textures here. So, we can leave it
 

275
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,909
these textures here. So, we can leave it
like this. But what I want to do is I'm

276
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:45,919
like this. But what I want to do is I'm
 

277
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,590
like this. But what I want to do is I'm
going to get another color ramp and I'm

278
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:47,600
going to get another color ramp and I'm
 

279
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,590
going to get another color ramp and I'm
going to take this wave texture. If I

280
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:49,600
going to take this wave texture. If I
 

281
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,749
going to take this wave texture. If I
just view it, that's what it looks like

282
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:51,759
just view it, that's what it looks like
 

283
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,230
just view it, that's what it looks like
there. That's what it looks like with

284
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:54,240
there. That's what it looks like with
 

285
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,550
there. That's what it looks like with
both of them combined. So, what I want

286
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:56,560
both of them combined. So, what I want
 

287
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,830
both of them combined. So, what I want
to do is take just the wave texture, not

288
00:04:59,830 --> 00:04:59,840
to do is take just the wave texture, not
 

289
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,670
to do is take just the wave texture, not
the noise, but the wave. And because it

290
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:01,680
the noise, but the wave. And because it
 

291
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,270
the noise, but the wave. And because it
is a larger texture, if I use it as a

292
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:05,280
is a larger texture, if I use it as a
 

293
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,310
is a larger texture, if I use it as a
way to mask out, so I'll bring this over

294
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:08,320
way to mask out, so I'll bring this over
 

295
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,430
way to mask out, so I'll bring this over
here to mask out parts of this larger

296
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:11,440
here to mask out parts of this larger
 

297
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,749
here to mask out parts of this larger
texture, it helps make it feel a little

298
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:13,759
texture, it helps make it feel a little
 

299
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,350
texture, it helps make it feel a little
bit more gives us some negative space,

300
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:15,360
bit more gives us some negative space,
 

301
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,670
bit more gives us some negative space,
but we still get to enjoy the texture.

302
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:17,680
but we still get to enjoy the texture.
 

303
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,469
but we still get to enjoy the texture.
So, what I'm going to do is I can move

304
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:20,479
So, what I'm going to do is I can move
 

305
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,550
So, what I'm going to do is I can move
it around like that. And then if we get

306
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:22,560
it around like that. And then if we get
 

307
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,310
it around like that. And then if we get
try testing something out here just for

308
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:24,320
try testing something out here just for
 

309
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,390
try testing something out here just for
fun. So you have this one moving this

310
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:26,400
fun. So you have this one moving this
 

311
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,310
fun. So you have this one moving this
way, this guy moving this way. So

312
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:28,320
way, this guy moving this way. So
 

313
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,670
way, this guy moving this way. So
everything kind of moves in that

314
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:29,680
everything kind of moves in that
 

315
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,909
everything kind of moves in that
direction. If I go ahead and I get

316
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:31,919
direction. If I go ahead and I get
 

317
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,830
direction. If I go ahead and I get
another node

318
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:33,840
another node
 

319
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,629
another node
and I make it white,

320
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:36,639
and I make it white,
 

321
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,550
and I make it white,
what happens is I can move this one here

322
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:38,560
what happens is I can move this one here
 

323
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,950
what happens is I can move this one here
and I can move this one here. So you can

324
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:40,960
and I can move this one here. So you can
 

325
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,629
and I can move this one here. So you can
move it from both sides, but you still

326
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:42,639
move it from both sides, but you still
 

327
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,189
move it from both sides, but you still
get that saw effect. And so you get

328
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:45,199
get that saw effect. And so you get
 

329
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,870
get that saw effect. And so you get
control of both. Or make this one white

330
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:48,880
control of both. Or make this one white
 

331
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,909
control of both. Or make this one white
and both of these black

332
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:51,919
and both of these black
 

333
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,510
and both of these black
and it it's going to kind of cut out

334
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:53,520
and it it's going to kind of cut out
 

335
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,469
and it it's going to kind of cut out
that middle. So, see that?

336
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:56,479
that middle. So, see that?
 

337
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,310
that middle. So, see that?
So, you can move this around. It's going

338
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:58,320
So, you can move this around. It's going
 

339
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,110
So, you can move this around. It's going
to cut that middle out. Now, this is not

340
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:01,120
to cut that middle out. Now, this is not
 

341
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,990
to cut that middle out. Now, this is not
preferable, but you can see how that

342
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:04,000
preferable, but you can see how that
 

343
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,270
preferable, but you can see how that
works. So, I'm just going to hit

344
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:05,280
works. So, I'm just going to hit
 

345
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,870
works. So, I'm just going to hit
control-z until I have both of these.

346
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:06,880
control-z until I have both of these.
 

347
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,909
control-z until I have both of these.
So, now we have this effect happening

348
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:09,919
So, now we have this effect happening
 

349
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,469
So, now we have this effect happening
right here. And you can bring it in,

350
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:12,479
right here. And you can bring it in,
 

351
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,390
right here. And you can bring it in,
crunch it in however, however much you

352
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:14,400
crunch it in however, however much you
 

353
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,110
crunch it in however, however much you
want. And then this detail scale is

354
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,120
want. And then this detail scale is
 

355
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,870
want. And then this detail scale is
going to have a lot of fun. So, play

356
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:18,880
going to have a lot of fun. So, play
 

357
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,590
going to have a lot of fun. So, play
with your distortion

358
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:21,600
with your distortion
 

359
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,150
with your distortion
and especially the detail scale until

360
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:24,160
and especially the detail scale until
 

361
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,070
and especially the detail scale until
you like what you see. I'm gonna go

362
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,080
you like what you see. I'm gonna go
 

363
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,550
you like what you see. I'm gonna go
ahead and delete one of these white uh

364
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:28,560
ahead and delete one of these white uh
 

365
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,309
ahead and delete one of these white uh
nodes and just keep keep it like this.

366
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:32,319
nodes and just keep keep it like this.
 

367
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,110
nodes and just keep keep it like this.
And so now we have a really really cool

368
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:35,120
And so now we have a really really cool
 

369
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,510
And so now we have a really really cool
scene. And again,

370
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:39,520

 

371
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,510

playing with the detail, playing with

372
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:41,520
playing with the detail, playing with
 

373
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,390
playing with the detail, playing with
the scale of this,

374
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:44,400
the scale of this,
 

375
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,909
the scale of this,
you can even play with the distortion of

376
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:45,919
you can even play with the distortion of
 

377
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,189
you can even play with the distortion of
the noise and you can get a lot of

378
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:47,199
the noise and you can get a lot of
 

379
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,110
the noise and you can get a lot of
stuff. So there's just a lot that you

380
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:49,120
stuff. So there's just a lot that you
 

381
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,870
stuff. So there's just a lot that you
can play with and the phase offset is

382
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:50,880
can play with and the phase offset is
 

383
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,550
can play with and the phase offset is
how this gets animated. Now what we can

384
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:52,560
how this gets animated. Now what we can
 

385
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,590
how this gets animated. Now what we can
do now is play with the fact that we

386
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:55,600
do now is play with the fact that we
 

387
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,070
do now is play with the fact that we
have emission strength that makes

388
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,080
have emission strength that makes
 

389
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,909
have emission strength that makes
something glow. So we have this color

390
00:06:59,909 --> 00:06:59,919
something glow. So we have this color
 

391
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,230
something glow. So we have this color
amp that's creating the color. So let's

392
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:02,240
amp that's creating the color. So let's
 

393
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,670
amp that's creating the color. So let's
go ahead and get a map range and plug

394
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:05,680
go ahead and get a map range and plug
 

395
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,110
go ahead and get a map range and plug
the noise texture into the value and

396
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:09,120
the noise texture into the value and
 

397
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,189
the noise texture into the value and
then plug the result into the strength.

398
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:11,199
then plug the result into the strength.
 

399
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,589
then plug the result into the strength.
What I want to do is get a bring our max

400
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:13,599
What I want to do is get a bring our max
 

401
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,390
What I want to do is get a bring our max
color to something that is that glows.

402
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:16,400
color to something that is that glows.
 

403
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,150
color to something that is that glows.
And if you play with the from minimum,

404
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:18,160
And if you play with the from minimum,
 

405
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,029
And if you play with the from minimum,
it is going to crunch that in to just

406
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:21,039
it is going to crunch that in to just
 

407
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,230
it is going to crunch that in to just
highlight a few of these and then bring

408
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:24,240
highlight a few of these and then bring
 

409
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,070
highlight a few of these and then bring
that minimum back to reveal the rest of

410
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,080
that minimum back to reveal the rest of
 

411
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,629
that minimum back to reveal the rest of
the texture. So what this is going to do

412
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:28,639
the texture. So what this is going to do
 

413
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,110
the texture. So what this is going to do
is bring out

414
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:31,120
is bring out
 

415
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,230
is bring out
these middle lines and those are going

416
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:34,240
these middle lines and those are going
 

417
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,150
these middle lines and those are going
to be only ones that glow. So then

418
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:36,160
to be only ones that glow. So then
 

419
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,749
to be only ones that glow. So then
whenever we play with the phase offset,

420
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:39,759
whenever we play with the phase offset,
 

421
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,189
whenever we play with the phase offset,
so let's find a spot where it looks

422
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:41,199
so let's find a spot where it looks
 

423
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,390
so let's find a spot where it looks
really really interesting like something

424
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:42,400
really really interesting like something
 

425
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,589
really really interesting like something
over here. When we play with the offset,

426
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:45,599
over here. When we play with the offset,
 

427
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,189
over here. When we play with the offset,
we get this really interesting look

428
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:47,199
we get this really interesting look
 

429
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,070
we get this really interesting look
where it's not all just everything, you

430
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,080
where it's not all just everything, you
 

431
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,150
where it's not all just everything, you
know, the same brightness, right? That

432
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:52,160
know, the same brightness, right? That
 

433
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,589
know, the same brightness, right? That
would look that's just not quite as

434
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:53,599
would look that's just not quite as
 

435
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,510
would look that's just not quite as
interesting. But if you do it like this

436
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:55,520
interesting. But if you do it like this
 

437
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,230
interesting. But if you do it like this
where we use this from minimum and just

438
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:58,240
where we use this from minimum and just
 

439
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,790
where we use this from minimum and just
highlight a couple of these lines and

440
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:00,800
highlight a couple of these lines and
 

441
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,909
highlight a couple of these lines and
then we have the rest at that color,

442
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:03,919
then we have the rest at that color,
 

443
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,950
then we have the rest at that color,
you can create a really, really cool,

444
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:06,960
you can create a really, really cool,
 

445
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,390
you can create a really, really cool,
really interesting looking animation

446
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:10,400
really interesting looking animation
 

447
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,550
really interesting looking animation
with combining some textures. So now

448
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:12,560
with combining some textures. So now
 

449
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,589
with combining some textures. So now
that we have this, you can go back and,

450
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:15,599
that we have this, you can go back and,
 

451
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,749
that we have this, you can go back and,
you know, edit your texture even more to

452
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:17,759
you know, edit your texture even more to
 

453
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,710
you know, edit your texture even more to
be whatever you want it to be. So play

454
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:20,720
be whatever you want it to be. So play
 

455
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,869
be whatever you want it to be. So play
with this until you like what you see.

456
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:22,879
with this until you like what you see.
 

457
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,589
with this until you like what you see.
And then see the alpha. So if I go here

458
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:25,599
And then see the alpha. So if I go here
 

459
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,189
And then see the alpha. So if I go here
to scene world. So if I just go here to

460
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:27,199
to scene world. So if I just go here to
 

461
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,950
to scene world. So if I just go here to
the material preview, you can see it's

462
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:28,960
the material preview, you can see it's
 

463
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,510
the material preview, you can see it's
just a flat plane

464
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:31,520
just a flat plane
 

465
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,310
just a flat plane
principled BSDF with emission on top of

466
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:34,320
principled BSDF with emission on top of
 

467
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,990
principled BSDF with emission on top of
it. You can't see through it. And I want

468
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:36,000
it. You can't see through it. And I want
 

469
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,829
it. You can't see through it. And I want
to add some things to the bottom. So

470
00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:37,839
to add some things to the bottom. So
 

471
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:38,949
to add some things to the bottom. So
what I'm going to do is I'm going to get

472
00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:38,959
what I'm going to do is I'm going to get
 

473
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,070
what I'm going to do is I'm going to get
a color ramp. I'm going to plug this

474
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:42,080
a color ramp. I'm going to plug this
 

475
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,149
a color ramp. I'm going to plug this
into the alpha. And then I'm going to

476
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:44,159
into the alpha. And then I'm going to
 

477
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,750
into the alpha. And then I'm going to
plug this mix into here.

478
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:47,760
plug this mix into here.
 

479
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,750
plug this mix into here.
And that should show what we're looking

480
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:49,760
And that should show what we're looking
 

481
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,910
And that should show what we're looking
for. You can switch it over to constant.

482
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:51,920
for. You can switch it over to constant.
 

483
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,550
for. You can switch it over to constant.
And then bring this in to make sure

484
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:54,560
And then bring this in to make sure
 

485
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,550
And then bring this in to make sure
everything we're seeing is what we want

486
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:56,560
everything we're seeing is what we want
 

487
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,110
everything we're seeing is what we want
to see. You can switch it over here to

488
00:08:59,110 --> 00:08:59,120
to see. You can switch it over here to
 

489
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,910
to see. You can switch it over here to
see. Okay. Yep. The transparency is

490
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:01,920
see. Okay. Yep. The transparency is
 

491
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,230
see. Okay. Yep. The transparency is
absolutely working. So that's what we

492
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:04,240
absolutely working. So that's what we
 

493
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,829
absolutely working. So that's what we
want. So bring it to bring your color

494
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:05,839
want. So bring it to bring your color
 

495
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,470
want. So bring it to bring your color
ramp to uh a constant and then just

496
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:08,480
ramp to uh a constant and then just
 

497
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,550
ramp to uh a constant and then just
crunch it all the way over there and

498
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:10,560
crunch it all the way over there and
 

499
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,550
crunch it all the way over there and
we're going to get transparency. So now

500
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:12,560
we're going to get transparency. So now
 

501
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,990
we're going to get transparency. So now
that we have this the animation is of

502
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,000
that we have this the animation is of
 

503
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,509
that we have this the animation is of
course going to come from the phase

504
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:17,519
course going to come from the phase
 

505
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,310
course going to come from the phase
offset just like this. It's going to be

506
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:20,320
offset just like this. It's going to be
 

507
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,870
offset just like this. It's going to be
a very sensitive phase offset. So let's

508
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:22,880
a very sensitive phase offset. So let's
 

509
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,310
a very sensitive phase offset. So let's
go ahead and create a grid floor beneath

510
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:26,320
go ahead and create a grid floor beneath
 

511
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,310
go ahead and create a grid floor beneath
it to give it that topographic map uh

512
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:30,320
it to give it that topographic map uh
 

513
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,030
it to give it that topographic map uh
like grid detail on the bottom. So,

514
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,040
like grid detail on the bottom. So,
 

515
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,710
like grid detail on the bottom. So,
let's just go ahead. I'm going to take

516
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:34,720
let's just go ahead. I'm going to take
 

517
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,949
let's just go ahead. I'm going to take
this plane. I'm going hit shift D. I'm

518
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:36,959
this plane. I'm going hit shift D. I'm
 

519
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,470
this plane. I'm going hit shift D. I'm
going to send it pretty far down. It

520
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:38,480
going to send it pretty far down. It
 

521
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,070
going to send it pretty far down. It
looks like my hit some buttons I didn't

522
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:40,080
looks like my hit some buttons I didn't
 

523
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,750
looks like my hit some buttons I didn't
want to hit. So, print send it far down

524
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:41,760
want to hit. So, print send it far down
 

525
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,750
want to hit. So, print send it far down
like that. And then if we go back here

526
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:43,760
like that. And then if we go back here
 

527
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,070
like that. And then if we go back here
to the view, you can see there's another

528
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,080
to the view, you can see there's another
 

529
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,430
to the view, you can see there's another
map down there. I'm going to go ahead

530
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:47,440
map down there. I'm going to go ahead
 

531
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,990
map down there. I'm going to go ahead
and just hit X. Click new. Hit the

532
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,000
and just hit X. Click new. Hit the
 

533
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,310
and just hit X. Click new. Hit the
period key and give it a strength of

534
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:52,320
period key and give it a strength of
 

535
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,750
period key and give it a strength of
like three. So, we have something down

536
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:53,760
like three. So, we have something down
 

537
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,710
like three. So, we have something down
there. Let's just scale it up.

538
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:56,720
there. Let's just scale it up.
 

539
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,509
there. Let's just scale it up.
I'm going to go ahead get my color ramp.

540
00:09:59,509 --> 00:09:59,519
I'm going to go ahead get my color ramp.
 

541
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,710
I'm going to go ahead get my color ramp.
Let's go ahead and plug this into the

542
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:00,720
Let's go ahead and plug this into the
 

543
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,990
Let's go ahead and plug this into the
color. We're going to get a We're going

544
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,000
color. We're going to get a We're going
 

545
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,710
color. We're going to get a We're going
to get a voroid texture and get a dot

546
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:04,720
to get a voroid texture and get a dot
 

547
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,910
to get a voroid texture and get a dot
grid for the bottom. So, I'm just going

548
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:05,920
grid for the bottom. So, I'm just going
 

549
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,509
grid for the bottom. So, I'm just going
to hit CtrlT, get that object

550
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:07,519
to hit CtrlT, get that object
 

551
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,030
to hit CtrlT, get that object
coordinate, and use the distance.

552
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,040
coordinate, and use the distance.
 

553
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,110
coordinate, and use the distance.
Bring random to zero. I'm going to flip

554
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,120
Bring random to zero. I'm going to flip
 

555
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,990
Bring random to zero. I'm going to flip
my color ramp and then bring this in.

556
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,000
my color ramp and then bring this in.
 

557
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,670
my color ramp and then bring this in.
So, now we're going to have a grid of

558
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:17,680
So, now we're going to have a grid of
 

559
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,550
So, now we're going to have a grid of
dots going beneath it. And you can see

560
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:20,560
dots going beneath it. And you can see
 

561
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,910
dots going beneath it. And you can see
that parallax effect, which is what

562
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:21,920
that parallax effect, which is what
 

563
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,670
that parallax effect, which is what
we're looking for. And then we're going

564
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:23,680
we're looking for. And then we're going
 

565
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,150
we're looking for. And then we're going
to give ourselves a nice blue. And then

566
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:28,160
to give ourselves a nice blue. And then
 

567
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,310
to give ourselves a nice blue. And then
what I want to do is let's just go ahead

568
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:30,320
what I want to do is let's just go ahead
 

569
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,790
what I want to do is let's just go ahead
and I'm hit shift D and get another

570
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:32,800
and I'm hit shift D and get another
 

571
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,069
and I'm hit shift D and get another
plane right about there. Let's go back

572
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:36,079
plane right about there. Let's go back
 

573
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,470
plane right about there. Let's go back
to the view.

574
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:38,480
to the view.
 

575
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,790
to the view.
And notice you can see that parallax

576
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:40,800
And notice you can see that parallax
 

577
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,430
And notice you can see that parallax
effect happening. What I want to do is

578
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:43,440
effect happening. What I want to do is
 

579
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,630
effect happening. What I want to do is
I'm going to go back to the flat view.

580
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:44,640
I'm going to go back to the flat view.
 

581
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,829
I'm going to go back to the flat view.
I'm going to click this bottom one. I'm

582
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:45,839
I'm going to click this bottom one. I'm
 

583
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,829
I'm going to click this bottom one. I'm
hit shift D and then bring it up just

584
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:47,839
hit shift D and then bring it up just
 

585
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,750
hit shift D and then bring it up just
kind of the middle portion there. Let's

586
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:49,760
kind of the middle portion there. Let's
 

587
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,389
kind of the middle portion there. Let's
go back to the render view. And right

588
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:52,399
go back to the render view. And right
 

589
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:53,590
go back to the render view. And right
here where it says number three, we're

590
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:53,600
here where it says number three, we're
 

591
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,430
here where it says number three, we're
just going to click that.

592
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:55,440
just going to click that.
 

593
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,190
just going to click that.
And let's go ahead and go from uklitian

594
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:57,200
And let's go ahead and go from uklitian
 

595
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,069
And let's go ahead and go from uklitian
to chbbyev. So now we have these

596
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:00,079
to chbbyev. So now we have these
 

597
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,870
to chbbyev. So now we have these
squares, but let's flip that

598
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:02,880
squares, but let's flip that
 

599
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,750
squares, but let's flip that
so that we have

600
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:07,760

 

601
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,990

this this uh grid here. So I'm going to

602
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:10,000
this this uh grid here. So I'm going to
 

603
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,670
this this uh grid here. So I'm going to
make it a little bit bigger. I'm going

604
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:11,680
make it a little bit bigger. I'm going
 

605
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,910
make it a little bit bigger. I'm going
to go from linear to constant so that we

606
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:13,920
to go from linear to constant so that we
 

607
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,030
to go from linear to constant so that we
can have the thinnest lines we can get.

608
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:17,040
can have the thinnest lines we can get.
 

609
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,910
can have the thinnest lines we can get.
So something like

610
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:19,920
So something like
 

611
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,269
So something like
that. And then I'm going to bring that

612
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:21,279
that. And then I'm going to bring that
 

613
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,949
that. And then I'm going to bring that
strength down. I don't want it glowing.

614
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:22,959
strength down. I don't want it glowing.
 

615
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,949
strength down. I don't want it glowing.
Now notice we don't see the dots

616
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:24,959
Now notice we don't see the dots
 

617
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,350
Now notice we don't see the dots
underneath. So we just need to plug this

618
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:27,360
underneath. So we just need to plug this
 

619
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,670
underneath. So we just need to plug this
guy into the alpha.

620
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:31,680
guy into the alpha.
 

621
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,350
guy into the alpha.
And then right here in the shader, we're

622
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:33,360
And then right here in the shader, we're
 

623
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,750
And then right here in the shader, we're
going to go here from uh dithered to

624
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:35,760
going to go here from uh dithered to
 

625
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,550
going to go here from uh dithered to
blended. And then now if I make these a

626
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:38,560
blended. And then now if I make these a
 

627
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,790
blended. And then now if I make these a
little bit thicker, you can see you can

628
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:40,800
little bit thicker, you can see you can
 

629
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,190
little bit thicker, you can see you can
see that parallax effect um working. So

630
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:43,200
see that parallax effect um working. So
 

631
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,470
see that parallax effect um working. So
we're just going to bring this down to

632
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:44,480
we're just going to bring this down to
 

633
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,630
we're just going to bring this down to
be really thin.

634
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:46,640
be really thin.
 

635
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,389
be really thin.
And then maybe a little bit brighter.

636
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:48,399
And then maybe a little bit brighter.
 

637
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,990
And then maybe a little bit brighter.
And then I do want this grid to be

638
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,000
And then I do want this grid to be
 

639
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,750
And then I do want this grid to be
bigger. Maybe a scale of one.

640
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:53,760
bigger. Maybe a scale of one.
 

641
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,630
bigger. Maybe a scale of one.
and then make this grid

642
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:56,640
and then make this grid
 

643
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,630
and then make this grid
as thin as I can. There's there seems to

644
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:58,640
as thin as I can. There's there seems to
 

645
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,389
as thin as I can. There's there seems to
be a limit to how thin the grid can be,

646
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:00,399
be a limit to how thin the grid can be,
 

647
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,470
be a limit to how thin the grid can be,
but that's okay. So, now all I need to

648
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:02,480
but that's okay. So, now all I need to
 

649
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,110
but that's okay. So, now all I need to
do is animate my camera and animate this

650
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:05,120
do is animate my camera and animate this
 

651
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,710
do is animate my camera and animate this
texture moving to look really really

652
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:06,720
texture moving to look really really
 

653
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,230
texture moving to look really really
cool. So, I'm going to pick a spot of

654
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:10,240
cool. So, I'm going to pick a spot of
 

655
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,910
cool. So, I'm going to pick a spot of
the texture that I think is really

656
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:11,920
the texture that I think is really
 

657
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,430
the texture that I think is really
really interesting. And then I'm going

658
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:13,440
really interesting. And then I'm going
 

659
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,150
really interesting. And then I'm going
to go and get an empty an empty plane

660
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:16,160
to go and get an empty an empty plane
 

661
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,870
to go and get an empty an empty plane
axis and place it right there so I can

662
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:18,880
axis and place it right there so I can
 

663
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,310
axis and place it right there so I can
get my camera to look at that. So I'm

664
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:20,320
get my camera to look at that. So I'm
 

665
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,190
get my camera to look at that. So I'm
going hit shift a camera control alt0

666
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:23,200
going hit shift a camera control alt0
 

667
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,350
going hit shift a camera control alt0
snap it to view and then in the

668
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:25,360
snap it to view and then in the
 

669
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,629
snap it to view and then in the
constraints tab I'm going to get a

670
00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:28,639
constraints tab I'm going to get a
 

671
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,389
constraints tab I'm going to get a
track two. I'm going to click that

672
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:30,399
track two. I'm going to click that
 

673
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,870
track two. I'm going to click that
empty. So now when I move my camera

674
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:34,880
empty. So now when I move my camera
 

675
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,790
empty. So now when I move my camera
it's going to stare right at the part I

676
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:36,800
it's going to stare right at the part I
 

677
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,590
it's going to stare right at the part I
want. But notice how this really cool

678
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:39,600
want. But notice how this really cool
 

679
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,470
want. But notice how this really cool
parallax effect is taking place. That is

680
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:42,480
parallax effect is taking place. That is
 

681
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,550
parallax effect is taking place. That is
the point of almost the entire point of

682
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:44,560
the point of almost the entire point of
 

683
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,230
the point of almost the entire point of
this tutorial is to make something

684
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:46,240
this tutorial is to make something
 

685
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,150
this tutorial is to make something
really cool with this parallax effect.

686
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:48,160
really cool with this parallax effect.
 

687
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,829
really cool with this parallax effect.
So, let's just go ahead and I'm going to

688
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:49,839
So, let's just go ahead and I'm going to
 

689
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,069
So, let's just go ahead and I'm going to
get myself maybe

690
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:52,079
get myself maybe
 

691
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,710
get myself maybe
400 frames.

692
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:54,720
400 frames.
 

693
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,310
400 frames.
And this won't be a looping animation.

694
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:56,320
And this won't be a looping animation.
 

695
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,430
And this won't be a looping animation.
The rare time this animation won't loop

696
00:12:59,430 --> 00:12:59,440
The rare time this animation won't loop
 

697
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,910
The rare time this animation won't loop
just because it would it's okay. We not

698
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:01,920
just because it would it's okay. We not
 

699
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,030
just because it would it's okay. We not
everything needs to loop. So, I'm going

700
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:03,040
everything needs to loop. So, I'm going
 

701
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,829
everything needs to loop. So, I'm going
to get a key frame. Just going to click.

702
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:05,839
to get a key frame. Just going to click.
 

703
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,670
to get a key frame. Just going to click.
I'm going to stretch there. And then

704
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:07,680
I'm going to stretch there. And then
 

705
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,069
I'm going to stretch there. And then
just go

706
00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:12,079

 

707
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,150

something like that. So, now we can look

708
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:14,160
something like that. So, now we can look
 

709
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,509
something like that. So, now we can look
at this.

710
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:17,519

 

711
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,670

Nice. It's really slow. The point is

712
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:19,680
Nice. It's really slow. The point is
 

713
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,829
Nice. It's really slow. The point is
just to really highlight that parallax

714
00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:21,839
just to really highlight that parallax
 

715
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,230
just to really highlight that parallax
effect. I can even bring um the dot grid

716
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:26,240
effect. I can even bring um the dot grid
 

717
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,310
effect. I can even bring um the dot grid
further down. This further down the dot

718
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:30,320
further down. This further down the dot
 

719
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,870
further down. This further down the dot
grid further down just to really make

720
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:32,880
grid further down just to really make
 

721
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,550
grid further down just to really make
that parallax effect a lot more

722
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:34,560
that parallax effect a lot more
 

723
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,230
that parallax effect a lot more
dramatic. And then let's head back to

724
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:36,240
dramatic. And then let's head back to
 

725
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,389
dramatic. And then let's head back to
the shading and animate the phase offset

726
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:42,399

 

727
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,110

of our animation.

728
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:45,120
of our animation.
 

729
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,829
of our animation.
So, we can go here, right over here, to

730
00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:47,839
So, we can go here, right over here, to
 

731
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,230
So, we can go here, right over here, to
the phase offset.

732
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:50,240
the phase offset.
 

733
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,910
the phase offset.
And it looks like this is a workspace I

734
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:51,920
And it looks like this is a workspace I
 

735
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,269
And it looks like this is a workspace I
haven't worked in yet. So, we're just

736
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:53,279
haven't worked in yet. So, we're just
 

737
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,470
haven't worked in yet. So, we're just
going to go ahead and get a

738
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:56,480
going to go ahead and get a
 

739
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,030
going to go ahead and get a
timeline.

740
00:13:59,030 --> 00:13:59,040
timeline.
 

741
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,269
timeline.
Let's go back here. I'm just going to

742
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:03,279
Let's go back here. I'm just going to
 

743
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,030
Let's go back here. I'm just going to
hit the key frame on the phase offset

744
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:05,040
hit the key frame on the phase offset
 

745
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,389
hit the key frame on the phase offset
and then I'm just going to move it

746
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:06,399
and then I'm just going to move it
 

747
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,870
and then I'm just going to move it
around

748
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:08,880
around
 

749
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,790
around
like that.

750
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:10,800
like that.
 

751
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,670
like that.
Now,

752
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:13,680
Now,
 

753
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,230
Now,
if I go back to layout,

754
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:16,240
if I go back to layout,
 

755
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,470
if I go back to layout,
we can watch this animation take place.

756
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:18,480
we can watch this animation take place.
 

757
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,509
we can watch this animation take place.
Are we real time? It's about 14 frames a

758
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:21,519
Are we real time? It's about 14 frames a
 

759
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,110
Are we real time? It's about 14 frames a
second. So, this is a bit slower than it

760
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:23,120
second. So, this is a bit slower than it
 

761
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,269
second. So, this is a bit slower than it
will be real time. But this is how our

762
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:27,279
will be real time. But this is how our
 

763
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,269
will be real time. But this is how our
animation is going to look and it's

764
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:29,279
animation is going to look and it's
 

765
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,189
animation is going to look and it's
going to be really, really cool. And you

766
00:14:31,189 --> 00:14:31,199
going to be really, really cool. And you
 

767
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,710
going to be really, really cool. And you
can have a lot of fun with it. Edit it,

768
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:32,720
can have a lot of fun with it. Edit it,
 

769
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,110
can have a lot of fun with it. Edit it,
change it, do whatever you want to it,

770
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:35,120
change it, do whatever you want to it,
 

771
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,110
change it, do whatever you want to it,
and it's just going to look awesome.

772
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:37,120
and it's just going to look awesome.
 

773
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,310
and it's just going to look awesome.
These uh effects just are really really

774
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:40,320
These uh effects just are really really
 

775
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,150
These uh effects just are really really
beautiful once you can play with them.

776
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:42,160
beautiful once you can play with them.
 

777
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,550
beautiful once you can play with them.
And maybe you can even go back to to

778
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:44,560
And maybe you can even go back to to
 

779
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,230
And maybe you can even go back to to
back to the shading and say maybe more

780
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:48,240
back to the shading and say maybe more
 

781
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,230
back to the shading and say maybe more
on the detail. Yeah, I think that looks

782
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:50,240
on the detail. Yeah, I think that looks
 

783
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,030
on the detail. Yeah, I think that looks
better. So now we can see a little bit

784
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,040
better. So now we can see a little bit
 

785
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,710
better. So now we can see a little bit
more

786
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:54,720
more
 

787
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,189
more
a little bit more interesting stuff here

788
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:57,199
a little bit more interesting stuff here
 

789
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,350
a little bit more interesting stuff here
on the details. But that is how this

790
00:14:59,350 --> 00:14:59,360
on the details. But that is how this
 

791
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,870
on the details. But that is how this
animation is created. Let me show you

792
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:00,880
animation is created. Let me show you
 

793
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,470
animation is created. Let me show you
how to export it and we'll be done. So

794
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:02,480
how to export it and we'll be done. So
 

795
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,069
how to export it and we'll be done. So
go here to the camera icon. Actually,

796
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:04,079
go here to the camera icon. Actually,
 

797
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,550
go here to the camera icon. Actually,
sorry the the printer icon. Select your

798
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:06,560
sorry the the printer icon. Select your
 

799
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,590
sorry the the printer icon. Select your
resolution. If you want 4K, do 200. I

800
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:09,600
resolution. If you want 4K, do 200. I
 

801
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,430
resolution. If you want 4K, do 200. I
highly recommend using a PNG sequence

802
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:11,440
highly recommend using a PNG sequence
 

803
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,189
highly recommend using a PNG sequence
and just compiling those. Just go ahead

804
00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:13,199
and just compiling those. Just go ahead
 

805
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,269
and just compiling those. Just go ahead
and choose your folder. If you want a

806
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:15,279
and choose your folder. If you want a
 

807
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,350
and choose your folder. If you want a
video instead of a PNG sequence, go to

808
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:17,360
video instead of a PNG sequence, go to
 

809
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:23,110
video instead of a PNG sequence, go to
FFmpeg video encoding to MP4 and then uh

810
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:23,120
FFmpeg video encoding to MP4 and then uh
 

811
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,430
FFmpeg video encoding to MP4 and then uh
medium quality to perceptually lossless,

812
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:25,440
medium quality to perceptually lossless,
 

813
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,590
medium quality to perceptually lossless,
and you'll be done. So, there you go.

814
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:27,600
and you'll be done. So, there you go.
 

815
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,030
and you'll be done. So, there you go.
That's how you create that. Again, if
