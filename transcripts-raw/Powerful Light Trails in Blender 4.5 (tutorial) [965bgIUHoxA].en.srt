00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,990

How's it going? So, in today's tutorial,

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:02,000
How's it going? So, in today's tutorial,
 

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,070
How's it going? So, in today's tutorial,
we're going to be making this animation.

4
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:04,080
we're going to be making this animation.
 

5
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,910
we're going to be making this animation.
It's honestly one of my favorite I've

6
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:05,920
It's honestly one of my favorite I've
 

7
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,430
It's honestly one of my favorite I've
done in a really long time. First thing

8
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:07,440
done in a really long time. First thing
 

9
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,870
done in a really long time. First thing
we're going to do is duplicate a bunch

10
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:08,880
we're going to do is duplicate a bunch
 

11
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,470
we're going to do is duplicate a bunch
of curves and make sure that they are

12
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:10,480
of curves and make sure that they are
 

13
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,150
of curves and make sure that they are
sitting in the right position. So, this

14
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:12,160
sitting in the right position. So, this
 

15
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,910
sitting in the right position. So, this
animation is going to loop. Then, we're

16
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:13,920
animation is going to loop. Then, we're
 

17
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,270
animation is going to loop. Then, we're
going to go ahead and displace the

18
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:15,280
going to go ahead and displace the
 

19
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,349
going to go ahead and displace the
curves and shape that displacement to

20
00:00:17,349 --> 00:00:17,359
curves and shape that displacement to
 

21
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,670
curves and shape that displacement to
look more like a topographic map. Then,

22
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:19,680
look more like a topographic map. Then,
 

23
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,349
look more like a topographic map. Then,
we're going to go ahead and parent a

24
00:00:21,349 --> 00:00:21,359
we're going to go ahead and parent a
 

25
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,189
we're going to go ahead and parent a
gradient to the camera movement, which

26
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:23,199
gradient to the camera movement, which
 

27
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,109
gradient to the camera movement, which
is going to create the animation. Then,

28
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:25,119
is going to create the animation. Then,
 

29
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:26,470
is going to create the animation. Then,
we're going to go ahead and edit that

30
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:26,480
we're going to go ahead and edit that
 

31
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,390
we're going to go ahead and edit that
gradient to create a really cool glowing

32
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:28,400
gradient to create a really cool glowing
 

33
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,910
gradient to create a really cool glowing
effect. And then after that, we're going

34
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:29,920
effect. And then after that, we're going
 

35
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,830
effect. And then after that, we're going
to use a wave texture to select the

36
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:31,840
to use a wave texture to select the
 

37
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,910
to use a wave texture to select the
center curves to make them brighter and

38
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:33,920
center curves to make them brighter and
 

39
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,750
center curves to make them brighter and
create a really nice focal point. Then

40
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:35,760
create a really nice focal point. Then
 

41
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,270
create a really nice focal point. Then
we're going to make a simple metallic

42
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:37,280
we're going to make a simple metallic
 

43
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,190
we're going to make a simple metallic
floor material, and we'll be totally

44
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:39,200
floor material, and we'll be totally
 

45
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,270
floor material, and we'll be totally
done. This animation is part of a series

46
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:41,280
done. This animation is part of a series
 

47

that being said, let's get into this

98
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:28,960
that being said, let's get into this
 

99
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,710
that being said, let's get into this
tutorial. All right, I'm going to start

100
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:30,720
tutorial. All right, I'm going to start
 

101
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,590
tutorial. All right, I'm going to start
uh and make my windows. So, I'm just

102
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:33,600
uh and make my windows. So, I'm just
 

103
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,830
uh and make my windows. So, I'm just
going to go down in this, go up on that.

104
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:35,840
going to go down in this, go up on that.
 

105
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,310
going to go down in this, go up on that.
I like my geometry nodes and my shading

106
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:38,320
I like my geometry nodes and my shading
 

107
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,870
I like my geometry nodes and my shading
to be the same uh this ways. You can do

108
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:42,880
to be the same uh this ways. You can do
 

109
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,190
to be the same uh this ways. You can do
however you want. There really is no

110
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:45,200
however you want. There really is no
 

111
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,789
however you want. There really is no
technical benefit to doing either way.

112
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:46,799
technical benefit to doing either way.
 

113
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,389
technical benefit to doing either way.
This is just what I preferably, this is

114
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:48,399
This is just what I preferably, this is
 

115
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,230
This is just what I preferably, this is
my preference. Let's head into geometry

116
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:50,240
my preference. Let's head into geometry
 

117
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,149
my preference. Let's head into geometry
nodes. First, let's hit shift A. Get a

118
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:52,159
nodes. First, let's hit shift A. Get a
 

119
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,510
nodes. First, let's hit shift A. Get a
plane. I'm going to title this geo. You

120
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:55,520
plane. I'm going to title this geo. You
 

121
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,710
plane. I'm going to title this geo. You
don't have to title it. Title it

122
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:56,720
don't have to title it. Title it
 

123
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,310
don't have to title it. Title it
whatever you want. And we're going to

124
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:58,320
whatever you want. And we're going to
 

125
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,389
whatever you want. And we're going to
click new here in geometry nodes.

126
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:00,399
click new here in geometry nodes.
 

127
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,149
click new here in geometry nodes.
Delete. Shift A. And we're going to

128
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:02,159
Delete. Shift A. And we're going to
 

129
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,670
Delete. Shift A. And we're going to
search a grid. And we're going to plug

130
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:05,680
search a grid. And we're going to plug
 

131
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,749
search a grid. And we're going to plug
this right into here. We're delete that.

132
00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:07,759
this right into here. We're delete that.
 

133
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,990
this right into here. We're delete that.
I'm going to hit shift A and get a

134
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm going to hit shift A and get a
 

135
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,750
I'm going to hit shift A and get a
quadratic bezier. Plug that here. Let's

136
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:13,760
quadratic bezier. Plug that here. Let's
 

137
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,510
quadratic bezier. Plug that here. Let's
do a couple edits here. So, one is a

138
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:15,520
do a couple edits here. So, one is a
 

139
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,869
do a couple edits here. So, one is a
resolution of 300. And we are going to

140
00:02:18,869 --> 00:02:18,879
resolution of 300. And we are going to
 

141
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,910
resolution of 300. And we are going to
go ahead click and drag here. Hit zero.

142
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:21,920
go ahead click and drag here. Hit zero.
 

143
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,990
go ahead click and drag here. Hit zero.
And then on the Y we're going to give it

144
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,000
And then on the Y we're going to give it
 

145
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,229
And then on the Y we're going to give it
a scale of 10. And that is going to

146
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:26,239
a scale of 10. And that is going to
 

147
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,510
a scale of 10. And that is going to
stretch it uh by essentially five units

148
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:29,520
stretch it uh by essentially five units
 

149
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,150
stretch it uh by essentially five units
here, 10 units here, 10 uh 10 m. And uh

150
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,160
here, 10 units here, 10 uh 10 m. And uh
 

151
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,229
here, 10 units here, 10 uh 10 m. And uh
we're happy with that. Now I want to do

152
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:36,239
we're happy with that. Now I want to do
 

153
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,830
we're happy with that. Now I want to do
uh some duplicates down the line of this

154
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:39,840
uh some duplicates down the line of this
 

155
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,910
uh some duplicates down the line of this
quadratic resier. the way I'm going to

156
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:41,920
quadratic resier. the way I'm going to
 

157
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,990
quadratic resier. the way I'm going to
make my array. Typically, if I'm

158
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:44,000
make my array. Typically, if I'm
 

159
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,550
make my array. Typically, if I'm
displacing immediately after uh making

160
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:46,560
displacing immediately after uh making
 

161
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,630
displacing immediately after uh making
the array, I like to use a simulation

162
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:48,640
the array, I like to use a simulation
 

163
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,390
the array, I like to use a simulation
zone for it. So, we're going to get a

164
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:50,400
zone for it. So, we're going to get a
 

165
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,790
zone for it. So, we're going to get a
simulation and we're going to plug here,

166
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:52,800
simulation and we're going to plug here,
 

167
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,229
simulation and we're going to plug here,
plug there, and then I'm just going to

168
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:54,239
plug there, and then I'm just going to
 

169
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,670
plug there, and then I'm just going to
bring it down. Let's go ahead and get a

170
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:57,680
bring it down. Let's go ahead and get a
 

171
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,470
bring it down. Let's go ahead and get a
I'm going to get a set position node, a

172
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:00,480
I'm going to get a set position node, a
 

173
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,509
I'm going to get a set position node, a
join geometry, and then plug the curve

174
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:03,519
join geometry, and then plug the curve
 

175
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,589
join geometry, and then plug the curve
into the join geometry. Just like that.

176
00:03:05,589 --> 00:03:05,599
into the join geometry. Just like that.
 

177
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,149
into the join geometry. Just like that.
I want to move it by

178
00:03:08,149 --> 00:03:08,159
I want to move it by
 

179
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,110
I want to move it by
13 this direction. Now, when I press

180
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:11,120
13 this direction. Now, when I press
 

181
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,270
13 this direction. Now, when I press
play, it is going to give me a bunch of

182
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:13,280
play, it is going to give me a bunch of
 

183
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,430
play, it is going to give me a bunch of
duplicates. And I believe 77 is the

184
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:17,440
duplicates. And I believe 77 is the
 

185
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,949
duplicates. And I believe 77 is the
amount that I wanted to go with. Then,

186
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:18,959
amount that I wanted to go with. Then,
 

187
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,270
amount that I wanted to go with. Then,
once you're done, you can go ahead and

188
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:21,280
once you're done, you can go ahead and
 

189
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,910
once you're done, you can go ahead and
get a bake node and bake it. And you're

190
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:23,920
get a bake node and bake it. And you're
 

191
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,630
get a bake node and bake it. And you're
all set. Now, I'm going to go ahead get

192
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:26,640
all set. Now, I'm going to go ahead get
 

193
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,350
all set. Now, I'm going to go ahead get
another set position node

194
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:29,360
another set position node
 

195
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,350
another set position node
just to move it to the center of where

196
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:31,360
just to move it to the center of where
 

197
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,190
just to move it to the center of where
I'll be working, using my camera, all of

198
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:33,200
I'll be working, using my camera, all of
 

199
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,110
I'll be working, using my camera, all of
that, just to keep everything uh in this

200
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,120
that, just to keep everything uh in this
 

201
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,869
that, just to keep everything uh in this
loop working correctly. So, I'm going to

202
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:36,879
loop working correctly. So, I'm going to
 

203
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,949
loop working correctly. So, I'm going to
go ahead on the X and the Y and do a

204
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:38,959
go ahead on the X and the Y and do a
 

205
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,869
go ahead on the X and the Y and do a
negative five. And that is just going to

206
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:40,879
negative five. And that is just going to
 

207
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,430
negative five. And that is just going to
plop it exactly where I'd want it to be.

208
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:43,440
plop it exactly where I'd want it to be.
 

209
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,030
plop it exactly where I'd want it to be.
Now, we can get our set position node

210
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,040
Now, we can get our set position node
 

211
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,710
Now, we can get our set position node
that is going to create our actual

212
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:46,720
that is going to create our actual
 

213
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,350
that is going to create our actual
displacement. So, let's get a another

214
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:49,360
displacement. So, let's get a another
 

215
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,750
displacement. So, let's get a another
set position node. We're going to get a

216
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:51,760
set position node. We're going to get a
 

217
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,390
set position node. We're going to get a
combine XYZ node. Plug that into the

218
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:54,400
combine XYZ node. Plug that into the
 

219
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,470
combine XYZ node. Plug that into the
offset. And let's plug a noise texture

220
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:56,480
offset. And let's plug a noise texture
 

221
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,070
offset. And let's plug a noise texture
into the Z. So, we'll get that noise.

222
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,080
into the Z. So, we'll get that noise.
 

223
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,030
into the Z. So, we'll get that noise.
Plug color into the Z. Now, we have some

224
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,040
Plug color into the Z. Now, we have some
 

225
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,550
Plug color into the Z. Now, we have some
displacement. I'm going to go ahead and

226
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:04,560
displacement. I'm going to go ahead and
 

227
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,030
displacement. I'm going to go ahead and
click on normalize. Give myself a scale

228
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,040
click on normalize. Give myself a scale
 

229
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,229
click on normalize. Give myself a scale
of 0.5. That looks really good. And then

230
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:10,239
of 0.5. That looks really good. And then
 

231
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,830
of 0.5. That looks really good. And then
let's get a vector math node so that we

232
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:13,840
let's get a vector math node so that we
 

233
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,150
let's get a vector math node so that we
can play with the strength of this

234
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:16,160
can play with the strength of this
 

235
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,310
can play with the strength of this
effect. We're going to click on scale.

236
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:18,320
effect. We're going to click on scale.
 

237
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,870
effect. We're going to click on scale.
And that is just going to be a scale

238
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:20,880
And that is just going to be a scale
 

239
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,469
And that is just going to be a scale
like a scale value here. So I'm just

240
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:22,479
like a scale value here. So I'm just
 

241
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,390
like a scale value here. So I'm just
going to keep it at one for now. And

242
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:24,400
going to keep it at one for now. And
 

243
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,550
going to keep it at one for now. And
what I don't want is if I look at here

244
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:26,560
what I don't want is if I look at here
 

245
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,870
what I don't want is if I look at here
from the uh right or the left, I want it

246
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:28,880
from the uh right or the left, I want it
 

247
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,310
from the uh right or the left, I want it
to kind of cut off. I want there to be

248
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:30,320
to kind of cut off. I want there to be
 

249
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,230
to kind of cut off. I want there to be
some flat portions. Right now it's like

250
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:32,240
some flat portions. Right now it's like
 

251
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,390
some flat portions. Right now it's like
all wave. I want some portions where it

252
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:34,400
all wave. I want some portions where it
 

253
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,350
all wave. I want some portions where it
goes down to look like the flat ground.

254
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:37,360
goes down to look like the flat ground.
 

255
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,430
goes down to look like the flat ground.
And so the way I can do that, the way I

256
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:39,440
And so the way I can do that, the way I
 

257
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,830
And so the way I can do that, the way I
prefer to do it, you can use color ramp.

258
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:41,840
prefer to do it, you can use color ramp.
 

259
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,430
prefer to do it, you can use color ramp.
That will just straight up crunch it

260
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:43,440
That will just straight up crunch it
 

261
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,150
That will just straight up crunch it
flat. That's not that fun. So we're

262
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:46,160
flat. That's not that fun. So we're
 

263
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,070
flat. That's not that fun. So we're
going to do a

264
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,080
going to do a
 

265
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,189
going to do a
RGB curves node. I'm going to add a

266
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:51,199
RGB curves node. I'm going to add a
 

267
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,469
RGB curves node. I'm going to add a
point here, here, here. And then the

268
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:54,479
point here, here, here. And then the
 

269
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:55,909
point here, here, here. And then the
part that's the most important, I'm

270
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:55,919
part that's the most important, I'm
 

271
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,189
part that's the most important, I'm
going to add a point right here in the

272
00:04:57,189 --> 00:04:57,199
going to add a point right here in the
 

273
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,830
going to add a point right here in the
middle of this bottom square. Bring this

274
00:04:59,830 --> 00:04:59,840
middle of this bottom square. Bring this
 

275
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,110
middle of this bottom square. Bring this
up. And that's going to create these

276
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:03,120
up. And that's going to create these
 

277
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,189
up. And that's going to create these
flat portions, but that aren't perfectly

278
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:05,199
flat portions, but that aren't perfectly
 

279
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,510
flat portions, but that aren't perfectly
flat. It's going to give you, maybe the

280
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:07,520
flat. It's going to give you, maybe the
 

281
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,350
flat. It's going to give you, maybe the
word nuance might be fun. It's going to

282
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:09,360
word nuance might be fun. It's going to
 

283
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,469
word nuance might be fun. It's going to
give you a little bit of nuance in the

284
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:10,479
give you a little bit of nuance in the
 

285
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,189
give you a little bit of nuance in the
flat portions, but not

286
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:13,199
flat portions, but not
 

287
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,189
flat portions, but not
completely kill um our ability to have

288
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:17,199
completely kill um our ability to have
 

289
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,029
completely kill um our ability to have
it more flat. And maybe we can bring it

290
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:19,039
it more flat. And maybe we can bring it
 

291
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,590
it more flat. And maybe we can bring it
down like this. Give it some more flat

292
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:21,600
down like this. Give it some more flat
 

293
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,710
down like this. Give it some more flat
areas. Um and then you can play with

294
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:24,720
areas. Um and then you can play with
 

295
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,189
areas. Um and then you can play with
that scale to give some parts that go

296
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:27,199
that scale to give some parts that go
 

297
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,870
that scale to give some parts that go
up. So now we have some flat parts that

298
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:28,880
up. So now we have some flat parts that
 

299
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,870
up. So now we have some flat parts that
are still a little bit wavy. And those

300
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:30,880
are still a little bit wavy. And those
 

301
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,150
are still a little bit wavy. And those
are really going to be pronounced once

302
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:32,160
are really going to be pronounced once
 

303
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,430
are really going to be pronounced once
we're playing with this animation some

304
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:33,440
we're playing with this animation some
 

305
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,830
we're playing with this animation some
more. So now we have this ready to go.

306
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:37,840
more. So now we have this ready to go.
 

307
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,909
more. So now we have this ready to go.
Now we are going to be making a looping

308
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:39,919
Now we are going to be making a looping
 

309
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,390
Now we are going to be making a looping
animation. And the biggest part of

310
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:42,400
animation. And the biggest part of
 

311
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,230
animation. And the biggest part of
making this loop is is uh the first and

312
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:46,240
making this loop is is uh the first and
 

313
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,230
making this loop is is uh the first and
the last frame needing to look exactly

314
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,240
the last frame needing to look exactly
 

315
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,469
the last frame needing to look exactly
the same so that this is a seamless

316
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:50,479
the same so that this is a seamless
 

317
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,749
the same so that this is a seamless
looping animation. The problem is if I

318
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:53,759
looping animation. The problem is if I
 

319
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,870
looping animation. The problem is if I
duplicate this tech this uh geometry

320
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:56,880
duplicate this tech this uh geometry
 

321
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,029
duplicate this tech this uh geometry
nodes

322
00:05:59,029 --> 00:05:59,039
nodes
 

323
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,510
nodes
uh whatever we're going to call it uh

324
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:01,520
uh whatever we're going to call it uh
 

325
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,230
uh whatever we're going to call it uh
object you could see how you can see a

326
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:04,240
object you could see how you can see a
 

327
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,430
object you could see how you can see a
seam or you know a very obvious seam.

328
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:07,440
seam or you know a very obvious seam.
 

329
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,150
seam or you know a very obvious seam.
You can see how it does not connect from

330
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:10,160
You can see how it does not connect from
 

331
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,590
You can see how it does not connect from
one duplicate to the next. How can I

332
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:13,600
one duplicate to the next. How can I
 

333
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,629
one duplicate to the next. How can I
duplicate this texture but make it so

334
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:16,639
duplicate this texture but make it so
 

335
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,870
duplicate this texture but make it so
that it connects? Because if we can't do

336
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:18,880
that it connects? Because if we can't do
 

337
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,350
that it connects? Because if we can't do
that, this animation breaks. So what I

338
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:21,360
that, this animation breaks. So what I
 

339
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,309
that, this animation breaks. So what I
need to do is first mirror this

340
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:24,319
need to do is first mirror this
 

341
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,710
need to do is first mirror this
displacement. Then I can duplicate the

342
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:26,720
displacement. Then I can duplicate the
 

343
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,749
displacement. Then I can duplicate the
displacement. So what I can do is get a

344
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:29,759
displacement. So what I can do is get a
 

345
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,870
displacement. So what I can do is get a
transform geometry node and a join

346
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:32,880
transform geometry node and a join
 

347
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,150
transform geometry node and a join
geometry node and then plug this into

348
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:36,160
geometry node and then plug this into
 

349
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,909
geometry node and then plug this into
the join. Now we what we've done is made

350
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:37,919
the join. Now we what we've done is made
 

351
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,270
the join. Now we what we've done is made
a duplicate. So remember

352
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,280
a duplicate. So remember
 

353
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,110
a duplicate. So remember
we uh made this 10 this a scale of 10

354
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,120
we uh made this 10 this a scale of 10
 

355
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,189
we uh made this 10 this a scale of 10
which means here on the here on the Y if

356
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:49,199
which means here on the here on the Y if
 

357
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,189
which means here on the here on the Y if
I here on the Y if I move it down by 10

358
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:53,199
I here on the Y if I move it down by 10
 

359
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,430
I here on the Y if I move it down by 10
it's going to perfectly move it down

360
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:55,440
it's going to perfectly move it down
 

361
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,189
it's going to perfectly move it down
this direction and then here on the

362
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:57,199
this direction and then here on the
 

363
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,990
this direction and then here on the
scale if I do a negative one it is going

364
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
scale if I do a negative one it is going
 

365
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,309
scale if I do a negative one it is going
to flip that and now it mirrors our

366
00:07:04,309 --> 00:07:04,319
to flip that and now it mirrors our
 

367
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,469
to flip that and now it mirrors our
displacement. There is a discernable

368
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:06,479
displacement. There is a discernable
 

369
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,029
displacement. There is a discernable
seam. It's not super obvious, especially

370
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:09,039
seam. It's not super obvious, especially
 

371
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,390
seam. It's not super obvious, especially
if you're just a viewer of the

372
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:10,400
if you're just a viewer of the
 

373
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,070
if you're just a viewer of the
animation. You're not looking for it.

374
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:12,080
animation. You're not looking for it.
 

375
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,029
animation. You're not looking for it.
Um, if this bothers you, there's really

376
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:15,039
Um, if this bothers you, there's really
 

377
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,950
Um, if this bothers you, there's really
not much you can do about it. But we now

378
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:16,960
not much you can do about it. But we now
 

379
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,110
not much you can do about it. But we now
have made uh a a mirror of this. So now

380
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,120
have made uh a a mirror of this. So now
 

381
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,350
have made uh a a mirror of this. So now
what I can do is get another

382
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:25,360
what I can do is get another
 

383
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,990
what I can do is get another
transfer uh transform geometry node,

384
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,000
transfer uh transform geometry node,
 

385
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,510
transfer uh transform geometry node,
join geometry, make another duplicate,

386
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:31,520
join geometry, make another duplicate,
 

387
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,070
join geometry, make another duplicate,
and move this guy down by 20. Now, we

388
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,080
and move this guy down by 20. Now, we
 

389
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,830
and move this guy down by 20. Now, we
can just literally duplicate, duplicate,

390
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:37,840
can just literally duplicate, duplicate,
 

391
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,990
can just literally duplicate, duplicate,
duplicate, and this is a seamless

392
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:40,000
duplicate, and this is a seamless
 

393
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,230
duplicate, and this is a seamless
pattern. So, that's what we're that's

394
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:42,240
pattern. So, that's what we're that's
 

395
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,990
pattern. So, that's what we're that's
what I wanted to make in order for this

396
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,000
what I wanted to make in order for this
 

397
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,110
what I wanted to make in order for this
animation to loop seamlessly. So, now

398
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:47,120
animation to loop seamlessly. So, now
 

399
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,790
animation to loop seamlessly. So, now
let's go ahead and give this a little

400
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:48,800
let's go ahead and give this a little
 

401
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,870
let's go ahead and give this a little
bit of geometry. So, I'm going to do a

402
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:50,880
bit of geometry. So, I'm going to do a
 

403
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,029
bit of geometry. So, I'm going to do a
curve to mesh

404
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:55,039

 

405
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,270

and a curve

406
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:57,280
and a curve
 

407
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,350
and a curve
circle. Uh just to keep this a little

408
00:07:59,350 --> 00:07:59,360
circle. Uh just to keep this a little
 

409
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,390
circle. Uh just to keep this a little
bit lighter, I'm going to do a

410
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:00,400
bit lighter, I'm going to do a
 

411
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:07,189
bit lighter, I'm going to do a
resolution of uh four, a radius of 0005,

412
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:07,199
resolution of uh four, a radius of 0005,
 

413
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,390
resolution of uh four, a radius of 0005,
and then I'm going to plug this right

414
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:08,400
and then I'm going to plug this right
 

415
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,390
and then I'm going to plug this right
into the profile curve. Now we have some

416
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:10,400
into the profile curve. Now we have some
 

417
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,790
into the profile curve. Now we have some
actual geometry we can add a material

418
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:12,800
actual geometry we can add a material
 

419
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,790
actual geometry we can add a material
to, which is uh this is going to be a

420
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:14,800
to, which is uh this is going to be a
 

421
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,189
to, which is uh this is going to be a
great time to start adding materials. So

422
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:17,199
great time to start adding materials. So
 

423
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,950
great time to start adding materials. So
we're going to get a set material node.

424
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:20,960
we're going to get a set material node.
 

425
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,189
we're going to get a set material node.
We're going to go here to the shading,

426
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:23,199
We're going to go here to the shading,
 

427
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,629
We're going to go here to the shading,
create a material, and then grab it

428
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:24,639
create a material, and then grab it
 

429
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,510
create a material, and then grab it
right here. You can even name it

430
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:27,520
right here. You can even name it
 

431
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,830
right here. You can even name it
And you can see that's the uh that's the

432
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:29,840
And you can see that's the uh that's the
 

433
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,430
And you can see that's the uh that's the
material we made. So what I can do right

434
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:33,440
material we made. So what I can do right
 

435
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,630
material we made. So what I can do right
now is before we create the material, I

436
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:36,640
now is before we create the material, I
 

437
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,230
now is before we create the material, I
want to get the camera moving because

438
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:38,240
want to get the camera moving because
 

439
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,909
want to get the camera moving because
the camera is going to affect the

440
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:39,919
the camera is going to affect the
 

441
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:44,389
the camera is going to affect the
shading. So let's let's do that. I'm

442
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:44,399
shading. So let's let's do that. I'm
 

443
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,590
shading. So let's let's do that. I'm
going to go ahead and show you guys my

444
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:47,600
going to go ahead and show you guys my
 

445
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,230
going to go ahead and show you guys my
method for kind of making sure loops

446
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:50,240
method for kind of making sure loops
 

447
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,870
method for kind of making sure loops
loop. So I know that I scaled this these

448
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:52,880
loop. So I know that I scaled this these
 

449
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,110
loop. So I know that I scaled this these
strings are 10 m long. So that means in

450
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:57,120
strings are 10 m long. So that means in
 

451
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,269
strings are 10 m long. So that means in
real space here if I hit S5 that is how

452
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:01,279
real space here if I hit S5 that is how
 

453
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,110
real space here if I hit S5 that is how
big our object our you know our

454
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:05,120
big our object our you know our
 

455
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,110
big our object our you know our
scene our object is and then we just

456
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,120
scene our object is and then we just
 

457
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,990
scene our object is and then we just
then we mirrored it right at there and

458
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,000
then we mirrored it right at there and
 

459
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,310
then we mirrored it right at there and
so our camera needs to go

460
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:14,320
so our camera needs to go
 

461
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,750
so our camera needs to go
uh the length of two of these cubes I

462
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:19,760
uh the length of two of these cubes I
 

463
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,509
uh the length of two of these cubes I
mean two of these planes. And if we do

464
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:21,519
mean two of these planes. And if we do
 

465
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,030
mean two of these planes. And if we do
that

466
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,040
that
 

467
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,430
that
it's going to loop. So, I'm going to go

468
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:25,440
it's going to loop. So, I'm going to go
 

469
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,829
it's going to loop. So, I'm going to go
ahead and just set up my camera view, my

470
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:27,839
ahead and just set up my camera view, my
 

471
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,590
ahead and just set up my camera view, my
camera angle, however I want it to be.

472
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:29,600
camera angle, however I want it to be.
 

473
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,310
camera angle, however I want it to be.
Something like this.

474
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:32,320
Something like this.
 

475
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,790
Something like this.
And then I'm get a camera control, alt0,

476
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:34,800
And then I'm get a camera control, alt0,
 

477
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,590
And then I'm get a camera control, alt0,
snap it to view. I like, if we go here

478
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:37,600
snap it to view. I like, if we go here
 

479
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,509
snap it to view. I like, if we go here
to the camera settings, a focal length

480
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:39,519
to the camera settings, a focal length
 

481
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,949
to the camera settings, a focal length
of 100. That really gives it this nice

482
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:42,959
of 100. That really gives it this nice
 

483
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,829
of 100. That really gives it this nice
flat view. And then I'm just going to

484
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:45,839
flat view. And then I'm just going to
 

485
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,230
flat view. And then I'm just going to
tighten my view in a little bit till all

486
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:48,240
tighten my view in a little bit till all
 

487
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,990
tighten my view in a little bit till all
the strings are within view. Now, what I

488
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:52,000
the strings are within view. Now, what I
 

489
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,910
the strings are within view. Now, what I
can do is I'm going hit the tilda key

490
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:53,920
can do is I'm going hit the tilda key
 

491
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,990
can do is I'm going hit the tilda key
and go to the top. I'm actually also

492
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:56,000
and go to the top. I'm actually also
 

493
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,990
and go to the top. I'm actually also
going to take I'm going to delete this

494
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,000
going to take I'm going to delete this
 

495
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,110
going to take I'm going to delete this
just to make sure you guys know what's

496
00:09:59,110 --> 00:09:59,120
just to make sure you guys know what's
 

497
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,509
just to make sure you guys know what's
going on. Take this plane and hit alt d.

498
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:01,519
going on. Take this plane and hit alt d.
 

499
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,150
going on. Take this plane and hit alt d.
That is going to create an instance. And

500
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,160
That is going to create an instance. And
 

501
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,190
That is going to create an instance. And
then hold down control and that is going

502
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:07,200
then hold down control and that is going
 

503
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,990
then hold down control and that is going
to snap everything. I neglected to say

504
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:10,000
to snap everything. I neglected to say
 

505
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,590
to snap everything. I neglected to say
that. Make sure that you are snapping

506
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:11,600
that. Make sure that you are snapping
 

507
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,030
that. Make sure that you are snapping
and then hitting alt d. And I'm hit alt

508
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,040
and then hitting alt d. And I'm hit alt
 

509
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,949
and then hitting alt d. And I'm hit alt
d again. And so what happens is when I

510
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:16,959
d again. And so what happens is when I
 

511
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,630
d again. And so what happens is when I
add a material to him, it'll add a

512
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:18,640
add a material to him, it'll add a
 

513
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,470
add a material to him, it'll add a
material to these instances that I just

514
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:20,480
material to these instances that I just
 

515
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,269
material to these instances that I just
created. So again, holding down control

516
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:23,279
created. So again, holding down control
 

517
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,350
created. So again, holding down control
so that this animation will perfectly

518
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:25,360
so that this animation will perfectly
 

519
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,949
so that this animation will perfectly
loop. And so now what I'm going to do is

520
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:26,959
loop. And so now what I'm going to do is
 

521
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,670
loop. And so now what I'm going to do is
I'm hit the tilt key, go to the top, and

522
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:29,680
I'm hit the tilt key, go to the top, and
 

523
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,670
I'm hit the tilt key, go to the top, and
the camera needs to start exactly on

524
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:31,680
the camera needs to start exactly on
 

525
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,910
the camera needs to start exactly on
this line here at the very very exact

526
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:33,920
this line here at the very very exact
 

527
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,990
this line here at the very very exact
edge of this uh cube, which is the exact

528
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,000
edge of this uh cube, which is the exact
 

529
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,870
edge of this uh cube, which is the exact
edge of this geometry node scene. So I

530
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:38,880
edge of this geometry node scene. So I
 

531
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,630
edge of this geometry node scene. So I
know that it needs to be

532
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:42,640
know that it needs to be
 

533
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,110
know that it needs to be
five. You can kind of see this thicker

534
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:45,120
five. You can kind of see this thicker
 

535
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,670
five. You can kind of see this thicker
line right here coinciding with that.

536
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:47,680
line right here coinciding with that.
 

537
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,670
line right here coinciding with that.
So, let's cut our let's get our

538
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:49,680
So, let's cut our let's get our
 

539
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,430
So, let's cut our let's get our
animation. So, I'm going to hit the back

540
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:51,440
animation. So, I'm going to hit the back
 

541
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,670
animation. So, I'm going to hit the back
arrow and then hit the back arrow again

542
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:53,680
arrow and then hit the back arrow again
 

543
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,389
arrow and then hit the back arrow again
on my keyboard to go to frame zero. And

544
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:56,399
on my keyboard to go to frame zero. And
 

545
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,829
on my keyboard to go to frame zero. And
then you can double check in your

546
00:10:57,829 --> 00:10:57,839
then you can double check in your
 

547
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,190
then you can double check in your
animation preferences. Your default

548
00:10:59,190 --> 00:10:59,200
animation preferences. Your default
 

549
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,110
animation preferences. Your default
interpolation is linear. That is going

550
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:01,120
interpolation is linear. That is going
 

551
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,030
interpolation is linear. That is going
to ensure a perfect loop. I'm going to

552
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,040
to ensure a perfect loop. I'm going to
 

553
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,829
to ensure a perfect loop. I'm going to
give myself 400 frames. Let me start my

554
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:07,839
give myself 400 frames. Let me start my
 

555
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,069
give myself 400 frames. Let me start my
camera at -5. I'm going to bring my uh

556
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:12,079
camera at -5. I'm going to bring my uh
 

557
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,310
camera at -5. I'm going to bring my uh
cursor to 400. I don't think cursor was

558
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:14,320
cursor to 400. I don't think cursor was
 

559
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,750
cursor to 400. I don't think cursor was
the right word. I'm going hold down

560
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:15,760
the right word. I'm going hold down
 

561
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,310
the right word. I'm going hold down
control, bring it all the way to the

562
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:18,320
control, bring it all the way to the
 

563
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,470
control, bring it all the way to the
edge of this second plane right here.

564
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:20,480
edge of this second plane right here.
 

565
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,310
edge of this second plane right here.
And you can double check. If it says 15,

566
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:22,320
And you can double check. If it says 15,
 

567
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,990
And you can double check. If it says 15,
you're in the right place. And now,

568
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:26,000
you're in the right place. And now,
 

569
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,990
you're in the right place. And now,
if I press play, let's watch the

570
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,000
if I press play, let's watch the
 

571
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,949
if I press play, let's watch the
animation. And uh wow, it's really slow.

572
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:32,959
animation. And uh wow, it's really slow.
 

573
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,350
animation. And uh wow, it's really slow.
Now, if I press play,

574
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:35,360
Now, if I press play,
 

575
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,030
Now, if I press play,
that's very, very slow, which is weird.

576
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:37,040
that's very, very slow, which is weird.
 

577
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,389
that's very, very slow, which is weird.
That didn't happen when I rehearsed

578
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:38,399
That didn't happen when I rehearsed
 

579
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,310
That didn't happen when I rehearsed
this. If it is really slow, you're not

580
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:40,320
this. If it is really slow, you're not
 

581
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,069
this. If it is really slow, you're not
getting any good playback, it's lagging

582
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:42,079
getting any good playback, it's lagging
 

583
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,790
getting any good playback, it's lagging
out. Um, what you can do is go back to

584
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:44,800
out. Um, what you can do is go back to
 

585
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,750
out. Um, what you can do is go back to
geometry nodes and get a

586
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:47,760
geometry nodes and get a
 

587
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,670
geometry nodes and get a
reample curve node. And I'll just plop

588
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:49,680
reample curve node. And I'll just plop
 

589
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,750
reample curve node. And I'll just plop
it right before the curve to mesh. And

590
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:51,760
it right before the curve to mesh. And
 

591
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,630
it right before the curve to mesh. And
that's going to just bring make your

592
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:54,640
that's going to just bring make your
 

593
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,710
that's going to just bring make your
essentially your curves low poly. And it

594
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:56,720
essentially your curves low poly. And it
 

595
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,470
essentially your curves low poly. And it
should Okay. Yeah. So that'll make your

596
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:58,480
should Okay. Yeah. So that'll make your
 

597
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,509
should Okay. Yeah. So that'll make your
scene a little bit lighter. You could

598
00:11:59,509 --> 00:11:59,519
scene a little bit lighter. You could
 

599
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,470
scene a little bit lighter. You could
remove that later. And so now we have

600
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:02,480
remove that later. And so now we have
 

601
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,470
remove that later. And so now we have
this. If we just watch the animation

602
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:04,480
this. If we just watch the animation
 

603
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,030
this. If we just watch the animation
play through all the way to the end. So

604
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,040
play through all the way to the end. So
 

605
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,629
play through all the way to the end. So
we'll just wait around. We're just going

606
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:08,639
we'll just wait around. We're just going
 

607
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,710
we'll just wait around. We're just going
to double check that this animation is

608
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:10,720
to double check that this animation is
 

609
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,750
to double check that this animation is
going to loop seamlessly. So, we're

610
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:13,760
going to loop seamlessly. So, we're
 

611
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,790
going to loop seamlessly. So, we're
watching

612
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:16,800

 

613
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,230

and then once we get to the edge, just

614
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:18,240
and then once we get to the edge, just
 

615
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,590
and then once we get to the edge, just
pay attention. Okay, loop seamlessly.

616
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:21,600
pay attention. Okay, loop seamlessly.
 

617
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,590
pay attention. Okay, loop seamlessly.
400 to zero. So, now we have that, we

618
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:25,600
400 to zero. So, now we have that, we
 

619
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,550
400 to zero. So, now we have that, we
can go ahead and start working on our

620
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:28,560
can go ahead and start working on our
 

621
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,030
can go ahead and start working on our
shading

622
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,040
shading
 

623
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,470
shading
because the camera's going, like I said,

624
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:32,480
because the camera's going, like I said,
 

625
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,750
because the camera's going, like I said,
the camera is going to heavily affect

626
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:33,760
the camera is going to heavily affect
 

627
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,710
the camera is going to heavily affect
the shading. So, I'm going to go back to

628
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:34,720
the shading. So, I'm going to go back to
 

629
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,350
the shading. So, I'm going to go back to
geometry nodes and I'm going to mute

630
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:37,360
geometry nodes and I'm going to mute
 

631
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,750
geometry nodes and I'm going to mute
that uh

632
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:39,760
that uh
 

633
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,110
that uh
that reample curve node.

634
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:43,120
that reample curve node.
 

635
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,829
that reample curve node.
So, we can go here now to the shading.

636
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:45,839
So, we can go here now to the shading.
 

637
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,069
So, we can go here now to the shading.
And we have that material that we

638
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:48,079
And we have that material that we
 

639
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:53,910
And we have that material that we
labeled dude for no reason. Um, and then

640
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:53,920
labeled dude for no reason. Um, and then
 

641
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,710
labeled dude for no reason. Um, and then
you can create this in EV or cycles. So,

642
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:56,720
you can create this in EV or cycles. So,
 

643
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,310
you can create this in EV or cycles. So,
I'm just going to design this in EV. I'm

644
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:58,320
I'm just going to design this in EV. I'm
 

645
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,430
I'm just going to design this in EV. I'm
going to personally render this in

646
00:12:59,430 --> 00:12:59,440
going to personally render this in
 

647
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,230
going to personally render this in
cycles cuz it just looks better. So, I'm

648
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:02,240
cycles cuz it just looks better. So, I'm
 

649
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,670
cycles cuz it just looks better. So, I'm
going to go down here and give myself an

650
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:03,680
going to go down here and give myself an
 

651
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,829
going to go down here and give myself an
emission strength of three. We can now

652
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:05,839
emission strength of three. We can now
 

653
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,269
emission strength of three. We can now
see this um this object. Now, I'm going

654
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:09,279
see this um this object. Now, I'm going
 

655
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,310
see this um this object. Now, I'm going
to go ahead get my color ramp, plug it

656
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:12,320
to go ahead get my color ramp, plug it
 

657
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,470
to go ahead get my color ramp, plug it
into the color, and I'm going to plug it

658
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:14,480
into the color, and I'm going to plug it
 

659
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,629
into the color, and I'm going to plug it
into the alpha.

660
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:16,639
into the alpha.
 

661
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,350
into the alpha.
Let's get a

662
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:19,360
Let's get a
 

663
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,430
Let's get a
gradient texture. And if you have the

664
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:21,440
gradient texture. And if you have the
 

665
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,110
gradient texture. And if you have the
node wrangler add-on enabled, comes with

666
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:23,120
node wrangler add-on enabled, comes with
 

667
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,790
node wrangler add-on enabled, comes with
Blender by default. Just hit control T

668
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:24,800
Blender by default. Just hit control T
 

669
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,389
Blender by default. Just hit control T
or get a mapping node and a texture

670
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:26,399
or get a mapping node and a texture
 

671
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,710
or get a mapping node and a texture
coordinate node and plug in the object.

672
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:28,720
coordinate node and plug in the object.
 

673
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,470
coordinate node and plug in the object.
And then plug color into color ramp. and

674
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:30,480
And then plug color into color ramp. and
 

675
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,310
And then plug color into color ramp. and
you're going to see this gradient

676
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:32,320
you're going to see this gradient
 

677
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,310
you're going to see this gradient
working. Now, in Eevee, see how it's

678
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:34,320
working. Now, in Eevee, see how it's
 

679
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,350
working. Now, in Eevee, see how it's
like this noisy transparency. You can go

680
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:37,360
like this noisy transparency. You can go
 

681
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,350
like this noisy transparency. You can go
here to the material settings and go

682
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:39,360
here to the material settings and go
 

683
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,110
here to the material settings and go
from dithered to blended. And that's

684
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,120
from dithered to blended. And that's
 

685
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,949
from dithered to blended. And that's
going to give you sort of that OG Eevee

686
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:42,959
going to give you sort of that OG Eevee
 

687
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,350
going to give you sort of that OG Eevee
looking uh transparency. And then here

688
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:45,360
looking uh transparency. And then here
 

689
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,829
looking uh transparency. And then here
on the rotation, I'm going to do a

690
00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:47,839
on the rotation, I'm going to do a
 

691
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,550
on the rotation, I'm going to do a
rotate it by 90°

692
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:50,560
rotate it by 90°
 

693
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,990
rotate it by 90°
so that it it's going the right

694
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:52,000
so that it it's going the right
 

695
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,110
so that it it's going the right
direction that I want. So, one thing we

696
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:55,120
direction that I want. So, one thing we
 

697
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,910
direction that I want. So, one thing we
need to do, I'm going hit shift A and

698
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:57,920
need to do, I'm going hit shift A and
 

699
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,030
need to do, I'm going hit shift A and
get an empty plane axis. What we're

700
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:01,040
get an empty plane axis. What we're
 

701
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,629
get an empty plane axis. What we're
going to do there is now I'm going to

702
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:02,639
going to do there is now I'm going to
 

703
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,430
going to do there is now I'm going to
click back on my uh curves and I'm going

704
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:05,440
click back on my uh curves and I'm going
 

705
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,189
click back on my uh curves and I'm going
to go over here to the object coordinate

706
00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:07,199
to go over here to the object coordinate
 

707
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,110
to go over here to the object coordinate
and grab the empty. So, what's going to

708
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:09,120
and grab the empty. So, what's going to
 

709
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,870
and grab the empty. So, what's going to
happen now is when I click on my empty

710
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:12,880
happen now is when I click on my empty
 

711
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,829
happen now is when I click on my empty
and I move the empty around, that

712
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:15,839
and I move the empty around, that
 

713
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,150
and I move the empty around, that
controls the position of the gradient.

714
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:18,160
controls the position of the gradient.
 

715
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,350
controls the position of the gradient.
So, here's what's cool. I'm going to

716
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:19,360
So, here's what's cool. I'm going to
 

717
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,710
So, here's what's cool. I'm going to
click on the camera. I'm going hold down

718
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:20,720
click on the camera. I'm going hold down
 

719
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,750
click on the camera. I'm going hold down
shift, click on the empty. Crl P and

720
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:23,760
shift, click on the empty. Crl P and
 

721
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,350
shift, click on the empty. Crl P and
click on object. Now what's going to

722
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:25,360
click on object. Now what's going to
 

723
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,990
click on object. Now what's going to
happen is I'm hit this drop down, click

724
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:28,000
happen is I'm hit this drop down, click
 

725
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,590
happen is I'm hit this drop down, click
on my empty and just bring it forward a

726
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:29,600
on my empty and just bring it forward a
 

727
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,910
on my empty and just bring it forward a
little bit. When I press play,

728
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:33,920

 

729
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,150

that transparency is going to the

730
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:36,160
that transparency is going to the
 

731
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,069
that transparency is going to the
because the empty is mapped to the

732
00:14:38,069 --> 00:14:38,079
because the empty is mapped to the
 

733
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,870
because the empty is mapped to the
camera. As this camera moves, it's going

734
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:40,880
camera. As this camera moves, it's going
 

735
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,870
camera. As this camera moves, it's going
to write or you know it kind of looks

736
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:42,880
to write or you know it kind of looks
 

737
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,350
to write or you know it kind of looks
like it's writing the geometry writing

738
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:45,360
like it's writing the geometry writing
 

739
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,269
like it's writing the geometry writing
these waves this sort of topographic map

740
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:47,279
these waves this sort of topographic map
 

741
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,430
these waves this sort of topographic map
vibe. So that is that is what I wanted.

742
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:51,440
vibe. So that is that is what I wanted.
 

743
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,030
vibe. So that is that is what I wanted.
So, that is how we create this really

744
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,040
So, that is how we create this really
 

745
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,310
So, that is how we create this really
cool effect. I'm going to go ahead and

746
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:54,320
cool effect. I'm going to go ahead and
 

747
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,110
cool effect. I'm going to go ahead and
make a uh timeline down here just for

748
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:57,120
make a uh timeline down here just for
 

749
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,269
make a uh timeline down here just for
me. Wherever it is.

750
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:01,279
me. Wherever it is.
 

751
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,030
me. Wherever it is.
So, now we can start making this look

752
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:03,040
So, now we can start making this look
 

753
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,870
So, now we can start making this look
really cool. So, go ahead and just click

754
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:04,880
really cool. So, go ahead and just click
 

755
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,710
really cool. So, go ahead and just click
on geo. We're going to go back here to

756
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:06,720
on geo. We're going to go back here to
 

757
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,750
on geo. We're going to go back here to
the the uh the color ramp. I'm going to

758
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:09,760
the the uh the color ramp. I'm going to
 

759
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,870
the the uh the color ramp. I'm going to
get a brand new node here. And then I'm

760
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:12,880
get a brand new node here. And then I'm
 

761
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,150
get a brand new node here. And then I'm
going to make it red so you guys can

762
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:14,160
going to make it red so you guys can
 

763
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,670
going to make it red so you guys can
kind of see the differentiation of what

764
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:15,680
kind of see the differentiation of what
 

765
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,230
kind of see the differentiation of what
what things are doing what.

766
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:18,240
what things are doing what.
 

767
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,790
what things are doing what.
This black portion is what we don't see

768
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:20,800
This black portion is what we don't see
 

769
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,710
This black portion is what we don't see
over here. It's the same thing that's

770
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:22,720
over here. It's the same thing that's
 

771
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,509
over here. It's the same thing that's
creating the alpha. So over here is

772
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:25,519
creating the alpha. So over here is
 

773
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,750
creating the alpha. So over here is
represented by this black node. And then

774
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:27,760
represented by this black node. And then
 

775
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,590
represented by this black node. And then
this white node is all the stuff behind

776
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:29,600
this white node is all the stuff behind
 

777
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,430
this white node is all the stuff behind
it. And this red one is obviously this

778
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:31,440
it. And this red one is obviously this
 

779
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,949
it. And this red one is obviously this
middle section. So what we can do

780
00:15:34,949 --> 00:15:34,959
middle section. So what we can do
 

781
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,990
middle section. So what we can do
is I can just make it

782
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:38,000
is I can just make it
 

783
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,310
is I can just make it
a pure white. Make it the brightest

784
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:40,320
a pure white. Make it the brightest
 

785
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,990
a pure white. Make it the brightest
thing. And this make it that darker

786
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:44,000
thing. And this make it that darker
 

787
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,350
thing. And this make it that darker
portion. And then bring this in. Bring

788
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:47,360
portion. And then bring this in. Bring
 

789
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,389
portion. And then bring this in. Bring
this in. And I'm actually going to

790
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:48,399
this in. And I'm actually going to
 

791
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,550
this in. And I'm actually going to
switch it over to constant so that

792
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:50,560
switch it over to constant so that
 

793
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,749
switch it over to constant so that
there's no fade between the two.

794
00:15:53,749 --> 00:15:53,759
there's no fade between the two.
 

795
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,389
there's no fade between the two.
And then I can just bring this in so we

796
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:56,399
And then I can just bring this in so we
 

797
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,910
And then I can just bring this in so we
have this one really bright section of

798
00:15:59,910 --> 00:15:59,920
have this one really bright section of
 

799
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,069
have this one really bright section of
the curves. So that's how we create that

800
00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:02,079
the curves. So that's how we create that
 

801
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,310
the curves. So that's how we create that
really cool effect. And then we can head

802
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:04,320
really cool effect. And then we can head
 

803
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,910
really cool effect. And then we can head
into the compositing. Turn on use nodes,

804
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:07,920
into the compositing. Turn on use nodes,
 

805
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,670
into the compositing. Turn on use nodes,
get a glare node, and turn on

806
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:11,680
get a glare node, and turn on
 

807
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,829
get a glare node, and turn on
fog glow. And then we can head back to

808
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:13,839
fog glow. And then we can head back to
 

809
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,470
fog glow. And then we can head back to
shading and then turn on always. And

810
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:16,480
shading and then turn on always. And
 

811
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,310
shading and then turn on always. And
that's how we get that glare. So you can

812
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:18,320
that's how we get that glare. So you can
 

813
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,110
that's how we get that glare. So you can
bring this up.

814
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:21,120
bring this up.
 

815
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,509
bring this up.
Just like that. So what I'm going to do

816
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:23,519
Just like that. So what I'm going to do
 

817
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,310
Just like that. So what I'm going to do
is bring this gray portion a little bit

818
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:26,320
is bring this gray portion a little bit
 

819
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,710
is bring this gray portion a little bit
brighter to be something right around

820
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:28,720
brighter to be something right around
 

821
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,470
brighter to be something right around
here.

822
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:30,480
here.
 

823
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,389
here.
And then let's do a really cool thing.

824
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:32,399
And then let's do a really cool thing.
 

825
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,949
And then let's do a really cool thing.
What I want to do is have a focal point

826
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:34,959
What I want to do is have a focal point
 

827
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,470
What I want to do is have a focal point
right here in the middle of the curve so

828
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:36,480
right here in the middle of the curve so
 

829
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,069
right here in the middle of the curve so
that it's not all just like all of them

830
00:16:38,069 --> 00:16:38,079
that it's not all just like all of them
 

831
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,990
that it's not all just like all of them
the same brightness. I think having this

832
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:40,000
the same brightness. I think having this
 

833
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,749
the same brightness. I think having this
really cool focal point will make this

834
00:16:41,749 --> 00:16:41,759
really cool focal point will make this
 

835
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,550
really cool focal point will make this
stand out. So, I'm going to go ahead and

836
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:44,560
stand out. So, I'm going to go ahead and
 

837
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,550
stand out. So, I'm going to go ahead and
get a mix color node. I'm going to hit

838
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:46,560
get a mix color node. I'm going to hit
 

839
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,590
get a mix color node. I'm going to hit
control shift D. So, duplicate the color

840
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:49,600
control shift D. So, duplicate the color
 

841
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,949
control shift D. So, duplicate the color
amp. Make sure the gradient is plugged

842
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:50,959
amp. Make sure the gradient is plugged
 

843
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,470
amp. Make sure the gradient is plugged
into it. And plug this into B. And I'm

844
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:54,480
into it. And plug this into B. And I'm
 

845
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,350
into it. And plug this into B. And I'm
just bring the factor over on this on

846
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:57,360
just bring the factor over on this on
 

847
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,670
just bring the factor over on this on
this one here. I'm going to get a hue

848
00:16:59,670 --> 00:16:59,680
this one here. I'm going to get a hue
 

849
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,269
this one here. I'm going to get a hue
saturation value node.

850
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:03,279
saturation value node.
 

851
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,789
saturation value node.
And I'm going to bring the value down to

852
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:04,799
And I'm going to bring the value down to
 

853
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,590
And I'm going to bring the value down to
zero. So now we have a color ramp that's

854
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:07,600
zero. So now we have a color ramp that's
 

855
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,590
zero. So now we have a color ramp that's
going to mix

856
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:09,600
going to mix
 

857
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,630
going to mix
between a zero one with a value of zero

858
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:12,640
between a zero one with a value of zero
 

859
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,150
between a zero one with a value of zero
and the default. And we're going to use

860
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:14,160
and the default. And we're going to use
 

861
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,150
and the default. And we're going to use
a wave texture to make what kind of

862
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:16,160
a wave texture to make what kind of
 

863
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,669
a wave texture to make what kind of
looks like a selection of the middle

864
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:17,679
looks like a selection of the middle
 

865
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,150
looks like a selection of the middle
ones. So let's get a wave texture.

866
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:22,160
ones. So let's get a wave texture.
 

867
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,949
ones. So let's get a wave texture.
Let's get in a

868
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:24,959
Let's get in a
 

869
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,189
Let's get in a
let's plug the mapping into that. And we

870
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:27,199
let's plug the mapping into that. And we
 

871
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,789
let's plug the mapping into that. And we
need to get a color ramp.

872
00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:30,799
need to get a color ramp.
 

873
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,549
need to get a color ramp.
Plug him here and plug him into the

874
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:32,559
Plug him here and plug him into the
 

875
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,950
Plug him here and plug him into the
factor so we can differentiate. So now

876
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:34,960
factor so we can differentiate. So now
 

877
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,190
factor so we can differentiate. So now
the wave texture is creating this. Now

878
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:37,200
the wave texture is creating this. Now
 

879
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,270
the wave texture is creating this. Now
if you like this effect, go nuts. Go

880
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:39,280
if you like this effect, go nuts. Go
 

881
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,950
if you like this effect, go nuts. Go
with it. We're actually going to go from

882
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:40,960
with it. We're actually going to go from
 

883
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,390
with it. We're actually going to go from
X to Y and it's going to create this

884
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:44,400
X to Y and it's going to create this
 

885
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,750
X to Y and it's going to create this
selection here. So I'm going to bring

886
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:45,760
selection here. So I'm going to bring
 

887
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,070
selection here. So I'm going to bring
the color ramp in like this.

888
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,080

 

889
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,270

And then I'm just going to bring that

890
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:51,280
And then I'm just going to bring that
 

891
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,549
And then I'm just going to bring that
phase to make this in the middle. So see

892
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:54,559
phase to make this in the middle. So see
 

893
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,390
phase to make this in the middle. So see
how it's over there? It's still a wave.

894
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:56,400
how it's over there? It's still a wave.
 

895
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,390
how it's over there? It's still a wave.
We're just sort of making the wave big

896
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:58,400
We're just sort of making the wave big
 

897
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,909
We're just sort of making the wave big
enough

898
00:17:59,909 --> 00:17:59,919
enough
 

899
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:04,390
enough
so that this selection is happening

900
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:04,400
so that this selection is happening
 

901
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,549
so that this selection is happening
here. So I want maybe that many of the

902
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:06,559
here. So I want maybe that many of the
 

903
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,070
here. So I want maybe that many of the
middle. And then we can go back to the

904
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,080
middle. And then we can go back to the
 

905
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,830
middle. And then we can go back to the
hue sat node and bring the value up a

906
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:11,840
hue sat node and bring the value up a
 

907
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,110
hue sat node and bring the value up a
little bit. So now we have these middle

908
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:15,120
little bit. So now we have these middle
 

909
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,990
little bit. So now we have these middle
ones brighter than the side ones. And it

910
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:18,000
ones brighter than the side ones. And it
 

911
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,870
ones brighter than the side ones. And it
looks super cool. All right. So let's uh

912
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:20,880
looks super cool. All right. So let's uh
 

913
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,390
looks super cool. All right. So let's uh
let's get this let's get this animation

914
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:22,400
let's get this let's get this animation
 

915
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,110
let's get this let's get this animation
over with. One thing I want to do, bring

916
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:25,120
over with. One thing I want to do, bring
 

917
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,190
over with. One thing I want to do, bring
this over. I'm going to get another

918
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:29,200
this over. I'm going to get another
 

919
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,830
this over. I'm going to get another
mix color node and I'm going to plug

920
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:31,840
mix color node and I'm going to plug
 

921
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,150
mix color node and I'm going to plug
this final mix color into the factor.

922
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:34,160
this final mix color into the factor.
 

923
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,669
this final mix color into the factor.
I'm going to make this one up here

924
00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:35,679
I'm going to make this one up here
 

925
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,150
I'm going to make this one up here
black, this one up here white, and then

926
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:38,160
black, this one up here white, and then
 

927
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,070
black, this one up here white, and then
just change the color. So, you can use

928
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:40,080
just change the color. So, you can use
 

929
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,909
just change the color. So, you can use
this mix node to change the color of all

930
00:18:41,909 --> 00:18:41,919
this mix node to change the color of all
 

931
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,190
this mix node to change the color of all
these things because then you'd have to

932
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:43,200
these things because then you'd have to
 

933
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,630
these things because then you'd have to
go like into each one, make sure the

934
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:44,640
go like into each one, make sure the
 

935
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,470
go like into each one, make sure the
color is this is sort of your master

936
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:46,480
color is this is sort of your master
 

937
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,710
color is this is sort of your master
color. And then we can just bring that

938
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:48,720
color. And then we can just bring that
 

939
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,590
color. And then we can just bring that
brightness up a little bit so we can

940
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:51,600
brightness up a little bit so we can
 

941
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,190
brightness up a little bit so we can
still get our glare. And this is getting

942
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:55,200
still get our glare. And this is getting
 

943
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,750
still get our glare. And this is getting
a nice color. Something like this. All

944
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:57,760
a nice color. Something like this. All
 

945
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,870
a nice color. Something like this. All
right, let's now focus on the floor

946
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:00,880
right, let's now focus on the floor
 

947
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,310
right, let's now focus on the floor
material. Make that pretty. And we're

948
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:02,320
material. Make that pretty. And we're
 

949
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,549
material. Make that pretty. And we're
going to be done. So I'm going to switch

950
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:04,559
going to be done. So I'm going to switch
 

951
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,630
going to be done. So I'm going to switch
over to cycles.

952
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:06,640
over to cycles.
 

953
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,909
over to cycles.
And then I'm going hit this drop down

954
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:07,919
And then I'm going hit this drop down
 

955
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,909
And then I'm going hit this drop down
scene scene world scene lights just so

956
00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:09,919
scene scene world scene lights just so
 

957
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,669
scene scene world scene lights just so
we can see what we're doing. So I'm

958
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:11,679
we can see what we're doing. So I'm
 

959
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,750
we can see what we're doing. So I'm
going to click this first plane right up

960
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:13,760
going to click this first plane right up
 

961
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,430
going to click this first plane right up
here in my outliner. I'm going to click

962
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:15,440
here in my outliner. I'm going to click
 

963
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,950
here in my outliner. I'm going to click
new. I'm going to make it metallic.

964
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:18,960
new. I'm going to make it metallic.
 

965
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,390
new. I'm going to make it metallic.
And then you can change the color just

966
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:20,400
And then you can change the color just
 

967
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,950
And then you can change the color just
to make sure you know. Yep. This is

968
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:22,960
to make sure you know. Yep. This is
 

969
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,110
to make sure you know. Yep. This is
affecting everything. Cool. So, what I

970
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:25,120
affecting everything. Cool. So, what I
 

971
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,549
affecting everything. Cool. So, what I
want to do is one, turn on my dinoiser.

972
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:28,559
want to do is one, turn on my dinoiser.
 

973
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,950
want to do is one, turn on my dinoiser.
So, we're going to get in a color ramp,

974
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:30,960
So, we're going to get in a color ramp,
 

975
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,430
So, we're going to get in a color ramp,
plug that into the roughness. We're

976
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:33,440
plug that into the roughness. We're
 

977
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,150
plug that into the roughness. We're
going to get in a voronoi texture. We're

978
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:36,160
going to get in a voronoi texture. We're
 

979
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,070
going to get in a voronoi texture. We're
going to hit control T, use the object

980
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:38,080
going to hit control T, use the object
 

981
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,029
going to hit control T, use the object
coordinate, and use color, plug that

982
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:41,039
coordinate, and use color, plug that
 

983
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,310
coordinate, and use color, plug that
into the color amp. So, now we're going

984
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:42,320
into the color amp. So, now we're going
 

985
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,710
into the color amp. So, now we're going
to get this really nice pattern. bring

986
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:44,720
to get this really nice pattern. bring
 

987
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,029
to get this really nice pattern. bring
random to the left and give it a scale

988
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:47,039
random to the left and give it a scale
 

989
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,950
random to the left and give it a scale
of 60.

990
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:48,960
of 60.
 

991
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,789
of 60.
And then right here, this black portion

992
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:50,799
And then right here, this black portion
 

993
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,789
And then right here, this black portion
of the color ramp represents the most

994
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:52,799
of the color ramp represents the most
 

995
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,830
of the color ramp represents the most
like shiny, most reflective portions of

996
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:55,840
like shiny, most reflective portions of
 

997
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,990
like shiny, most reflective portions of
this texture. I'm just going to bring it

998
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:58,000
this texture. I'm just going to bring it
 

999
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,669
this texture. I'm just going to bring it
up just a little bit so it's not

1000
00:19:59,669 --> 00:19:59,679
up just a little bit so it's not
 

1001
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,430
up just a little bit so it's not
perfectly mirror like. And then I'm

1002
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:01,440
perfectly mirror like. And then I'm
 

1003
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,789
perfectly mirror like. And then I'm
going to bring this one down a little

1004
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:02,799
going to bring this one down a little
 

1005
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,310
going to bring this one down a little
bit so that everything is kind of in

1006
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:04,320
bit so that everything is kind of in
 

1007
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,150
bit so that everything is kind of in
that middle ground. You can see how it's

1008
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:06,160
that middle ground. You can see how it's
 

1009
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,789
that middle ground. You can see how it's
looking over there over here. Next thing

1010
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:08,799
looking over there over here. Next thing
 

1011
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,470
looking over there over here. Next thing
I'm going to do is I'm going to get a

1012
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:10,480
I'm going to do is I'm going to get a
 

1013
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,669
I'm going to do is I'm going to get a
bump node. plug color into height,

1014
00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:13,679
bump node. plug color into height,
 

1015
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,669
bump node. plug color into height,
normal to normal. And then I'm going to

1016
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:15,679
normal to normal. And then I'm going to
 

1017
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,390
normal to normal. And then I'm going to
do a filter width of 1.5.

1018
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:18,400
do a filter width of 1.5.
 

1019
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,750
do a filter width of 1.5.
That's going to give us this nice

1020
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:19,760
That's going to give us this nice
 

1021
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,270
That's going to give us this nice
bumpiness that's going to affect the

1022
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:21,280
bumpiness that's going to affect the
 

1023
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,310
bumpiness that's going to affect the
light. Last thing I want to do is I'm

1024
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:24,320
light. Last thing I want to do is I'm
 

1025
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,070
light. Last thing I want to do is I'm
going to click on my wires here. I'm

1026
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:26,080
going to click on my wires here. I'm
 

1027
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,669
going to click on my wires here. I'm
going to hover over here and hit Ctrl +

1028
00:20:27,669 --> 00:20:27,679
going to hover over here and hit Ctrl +
 

1029
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,270
going to hover over here and hit Ctrl +
C. Go back over here.

1030
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:31,280
C. Go back over here.
 

1031
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,230
C. Go back over here.
We're going to get a color ramp.

1032
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:34,240
We're going to get a color ramp.
 

1033
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,750
We're going to get a color ramp.
I'm going to click on the white one and

1034
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:35,760
I'm going to click on the white one and
 

1035
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,230
I'm going to click on the white one and
just Ctrl +V. Paste that color into

1036
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:38,240
just Ctrl +V. Paste that color into
 

1037
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,590
just Ctrl +V. Paste that color into
there. Color here. color of the voronoi.

1038
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:41,600
there. Color here. color of the voronoi.
 

1039
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,710
there. Color here. color of the voronoi.
Plug it into that. And then we're going

1040
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:42,720
Plug it into that. And then we're going
 

1041
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,830
Plug it into that. And then we're going
to give it a strength of like three.

1042
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:45,840
to give it a strength of like three.
 

1043
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,510
to give it a strength of like three.
I'mma hit this drop down. We're just

1044
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:47,520
I'mma hit this drop down. We're just
 

1045
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,990
I'mma hit this drop down. We're just
going to go back to our normal lights

1046
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:50,000
going to go back to our normal lights
 

1047
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,470
going to go back to our normal lights
and then bring this black portion of the

1048
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:52,480
and then bring this black portion of the
 

1049
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,430
and then bring this black portion of the
color amp in until we get enough of

1050
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:55,440
color amp in until we get enough of
 

1051
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,390
color amp in until we get enough of
these little orange pieces.

1052
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:58,400
these little orange pieces.
 

1053
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,750
these little orange pieces.
What that gives us is if I get my world

1054
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:01,760
What that gives us is if I get my world
 

1055
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,149
What that gives us is if I get my world
brightness to be black,

1056
00:21:04,149 --> 00:21:04,159
brightness to be black,
 

1057
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,630
brightness to be black,
a little bit of context of, oh, there's

1058
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:06,640
a little bit of context of, oh, there's
 

1059
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,830
a little bit of context of, oh, there's
some still some stuff over there.

1060
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:07,840
some still some stuff over there.
 

1061
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,909
some still some stuff over there.
Because if I look at this in Eevee, let

1062
00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:09,919
Because if I look at this in Eevee, let
 

1063
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,230
Because if I look at this in Eevee, let
me just get my normal lights. As we're

1064
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:12,240
me just get my normal lights. As we're
 

1065
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,830
me just get my normal lights. As we're
moving, those little cubes are going to

1066
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:13,840
moving, those little cubes are going to
 

1067
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,230
moving, those little cubes are going to
move at us. And I just think that makes

1068
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:16,240
move at us. And I just think that makes
 

1069
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,310
move at us. And I just think that makes
gives this a little bit more context.

1070
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:18,320
gives this a little bit more context.
 

1071
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,750
gives this a little bit more context.
I'm going to go and move my

1072
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:21,760
I'm going to go and move my
 

1073
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,750
I'm going to go and move my
um empty up a little bit. I want more of

1074
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:23,760
um empty up a little bit. I want more of
 

1075
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,510
um empty up a little bit. I want more of
these waves to be making up this scene.

1076
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:27,520
these waves to be making up this scene.
 

1077
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,830
these waves to be making up this scene.
So, this is what we have so far. What I

1078
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:29,840
So, this is what we have so far. What I
 

1079
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,830
So, this is what we have so far. What I
want to do is bring down the value of

1080
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:33,840
want to do is bring down the value of
 

1081

1095
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,630
and I'm going to go ahead and click on
depth of field. Bring the f-stop down

1096
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:54,640
depth of field. Bring the f-stop down
 

1097
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,470
depth of field. Bring the f-stop down
really far so we can see exactly what

1098
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:56,480
really far so we can see exactly what
 

1099
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,270
really far so we can see exactly what
it's focusing on. And then just focus on

1100
00:21:59,270 --> 00:21:59,280
it's focusing on. And then just focus on
 

1101
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,950
it's focusing on. And then just focus on
those middle portions. And then you can

1102
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:00,960
those middle portions. And then you can
 

1103
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,510
those middle portions. And then you can
go and bring your f-stop back up till

1104
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:03,520
go and bring your f-stop back up till
 

1105
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,750
go and bring your f-stop back up till
you like how sensitive it is. You can

1106
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:05,760
you like how sensitive it is. You can
 

1107
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,390
you like how sensitive it is. You can
even at this point bring your camera in

done. Let me go ahead and just give this
 

1117
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,430
done. Let me go ahead and just give this
one render and see how this final output

1118
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:21,440
one render and see how this final output
 

1119
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,590
one render and see how this final output
is going to look. So here we go. This is

1120
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:23,600
is going to look. So here we go. This is
 

1121
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,310
is going to look. So here we go. This is
a the final output of this animation. It

1122
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:26,320
a the final output of this animation. It
 

1123
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,669
a the final output of this animation. It
looks really awesome. It's really

1124
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:27,679
looks really awesome. It's really
 

1125

with it. Let me show you the export

1128
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:31,039
with it. Let me show you the export
 

1129
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,950
with it. Let me show you the export
settings that I would recommend for this

1130
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:32,960
settings that I would recommend for this
 

1131
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,270
settings that I would recommend for this
uh 1920 x 1080 or if you want it 4K,

1132
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:35,280
uh 1920 x 1080 or if you want it 4K,
 

1133
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,590
uh 1920 x 1080 or if you want it 4K,
just type in 200. I would highly

1134
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:37,600
just type in 200. I would highly
 

1135
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,510
just type in 200. I would highly
recommend a PNG sequence. Just make a

1136
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:39,520
recommend a PNG sequence. Just make a
 

1137
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,870
recommend a PNG sequence. Just make a
folder, throw them in there, and then

1138
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:40,880
folder, throw them in there, and then
 

1139
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,789
folder, throw them in there, and then
compile that. If you don't want to do

1140
00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:42,799
compile that. If you don't want to do
 

1141
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,630
compile that. If you don't want to do
that, you just want Blender to sped out

1142
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:44,640
that, you just want Blender to sped out
 

1143
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,950
that, you just want Blender to sped out
a video. You don't want to compile PGs,

1144
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:46,960
a video. You don't want to compile PGs,
 

1145
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,990
a video. You don't want to compile PGs,
you can go here to FFmpeg video, uh

1146
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:50,000
you can go here to FFmpeg video, uh
 

1147
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,710
you can go here to FFmpeg video, uh
encoding to MP4 or QuickTime. If you're

1148
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:52,720
encoding to MP4 or QuickTime. If you're
 

1149
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,590
encoding to MP4 or QuickTime. If you're
on Mac, use QuickTime. Um MP4 if you're

1150
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:55,600
on Mac, use QuickTime. Um MP4 if you're
 

1151
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,510
on Mac, use QuickTime. Um MP4 if you're
on a PC. and then do perceptually

1152
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:57,520
on a PC. and then do perceptually
 

1153
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,750
on a PC. and then do perceptually
lossless render render animation and

1154
00:22:59,750 --> 00:22:59,760
lossless render render animation and
 

1155
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,029
lossless render render animation and
when you're done you'll have something

1156
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:01,039
when you're done you'll have something
 

1157
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,789
when you're done you'll have something
really cool like mine. So there you go.
