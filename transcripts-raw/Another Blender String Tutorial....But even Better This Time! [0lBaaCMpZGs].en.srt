00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:01,920
How's it going? In this tutorial, I'm
 

3
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,590
How's it going? In this tutorial, I'm
going to show you how to create this

4
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:03,600
going to show you how to create this
 

5
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,110
going to show you how to create this
animation right here. There's actually

6
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:05,120
animation right here. There's actually
 

7
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,430
animation right here. There's actually
going to be two animations in this

8
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:07,440
going to be two animations in this
 

9
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,790
going to be two animations in this
tutorial that you'll be able to pick

10
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:08,800
tutorial that you'll be able to pick
 

11
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,629
tutorial that you'll be able to pick
from, or you can do both. Here's the

12
00:00:10,629 --> 00:00:10,639
from, or you can do both. Here's the
 

13
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:11,910
from, or you can do both. Here's the
steps that we're going to go through to

14
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:11,920
steps that we're going to go through to
 

15
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,230
steps that we're going to go through to
create this animation. First, we need to

16
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:14,240
create this animation. First, we need to
 

17
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,029
create this animation. First, we need to
simulate an array of curves. Then, we're

18
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:17,039
simulate an array of curves. Then, we're
 

19
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,710
simulate an array of curves. Then, we're
going to go ahead and displace those

20
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:18,720
going to go ahead and displace those
 

21
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,590
going to go ahead and displace those
curves. Each curve needs its own W value

22
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:21,600
curves. Each curve needs its own W value
 

23
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,870
curves. Each curve needs its own W value
to give it a little bit more of a

24
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:22,880
to give it a little bit more of a
 

25
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,870
to give it a little bit more of a
realistic stringy look. Then we can use

26
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:24,880
realistic stringy look. Then we can use
 

27
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,550
realistic stringy look. Then we can use
a little bit of math to isolate the

28
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:26,560
a little bit of math to isolate the
 

29
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,390
a little bit of math to isolate the
displacement to the center. Or we can

30
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:28,400
displacement to the center. Or we can
 

31
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,070
displacement to the center. Or we can
use a different set of nodes to animate

32
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:30,080
use a different set of nodes to animate
 

33
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,549
use a different set of nodes to animate
the string coming in and out. After

34
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:32,559
the string coming in and out. After
 

35
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:34,790
the string coming in and out. After
that, we just need to add some color,

36
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:34,800
that, we just need to add some color,
 

37
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,350
that, we just need to add some color,
add some lighting, and we'll be done.

38
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:37,360
add some lighting, and we'll be done.
 

39
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,030
add some lighting, and we'll be done.

tutorial. So, first we're going to go

72
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:07,360
tutorial. So, first we're going to go
 

73
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,670
tutorial. So, first we're going to go
ahead and throw a piece of geometry into

74
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:09,680
ahead and throw a piece of geometry into
 

75
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,109
ahead and throw a piece of geometry into
our scene. And I'm going to go and cut

76
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:11,119
our scene. And I'm going to go and cut
 

77
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,510
our scene. And I'm going to go and cut
my window in half up here. We're going

78
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:13,520
my window in half up here. We're going
 

79
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,109
my window in half up here. We're going
to switch it over to the geometry nodes

80
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:15,119
to switch it over to the geometry nodes
 

81
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,109
to switch it over to the geometry nodes
editor. I'm going to hit N to move that.

82
00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:17,119
editor. I'm going to hit N to move that.
 

83
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,710
editor. I'm going to hit N to move that.
We're going to get a new window and

84
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:18,720
We're going to get a new window and
 

85
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,390
We're going to get a new window and
we're going to go ahead and delete this

86
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:20,400
we're going to go ahead and delete this
 

87
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,149
we're going to go ahead and delete this
input and we're going to go ahead and

88
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:22,159
input and we're going to go ahead and
 

89
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,390
input and we're going to go ahead and
get a quadratic bezier. So, shift a

90
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:24,400
get a quadratic bezier. So, shift a
 

91
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,789
get a quadratic bezier. So, shift a
search quadratic bezier. We're going to

92
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:26,799
search quadratic bezier. We're going to
 

93
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,550
search quadratic bezier. We're going to
plug it right into here. First, what

94
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:28,560
plug it right into here. First, what
 

95
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,510
plug it right into here. First, what
we're going to do is notice this

96
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:29,520
we're going to do is notice this
 

97
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,670
we're going to do is notice this
quadratic bezier is just curved right

98
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:31,680
quadratic bezier is just curved right
 

99
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,069
quadratic bezier is just curved right
now. I'm going to go ahead and click and

100
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:34,079
now. I'm going to go ahead and click and
 

101
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,990
now. I'm going to go ahead and click and
drag. Bring it down to zero. And on the

102
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,000
drag. Bring it down to zero. And on the
 

103
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,429
drag. Bring it down to zero. And on the
y-axis, we're going to give it a value

104
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:37,439
y-axis, we're going to give it a value
 

105
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,670
y-axis, we're going to give it a value
of four. That's going to stretch that

106
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:39,680
of four. That's going to stretch that
 

107
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,030
of four. That's going to stretch that
curve that direction. And we're going to

108
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,040
curve that direction. And we're going to
 

109
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,830
curve that direction. And we're going to
give it a resolution of 400. Now, we're

110
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:43,840
give it a resolution of 400. Now, we're
 

111
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,789
give it a resolution of 400. Now, we're
going to go ahead get a

112
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:46,799
going to go ahead get a
 

113
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,749
going to go ahead get a
transform geometry node. And I just want

114
00:01:49,749 --> 00:01:49,759
transform geometry node. And I just want
 

115
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,749
transform geometry node. And I just want
to bring this curve here to the center

116
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:51,759
to bring this curve here to the center
 

117
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,510
to bring this curve here to the center
of the scene. Not necessary, but it's

118
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:53,520
of the scene. Not necessary, but it's
 

119
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,270
of the scene. Not necessary, but it's
just something that I like uh to have

120
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:55,280
just something that I like uh to have
 

121
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,109
just something that I like uh to have
everything centered out. And then now

122
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:57,119
everything centered out. And then now
 

123
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,469
everything centered out. And then now
we're going to go ahead and add the

124
00:01:58,469 --> 00:01:58,479
we're going to go ahead and add the
 

125
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,310
we're going to go ahead and add the
simulation zone. Now, if this is your

126
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:00,320
simulation zone. Now, if this is your
 

127
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,389
simulation zone. Now, if this is your
first time using simulation zones, this

128
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:02,399
first time using simulation zones, this
 

129
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,550
first time using simulation zones, this
is actually a perfect gateway into it.

130
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:04,560
is actually a perfect gateway into it.
 

131
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,830
is actually a perfect gateway into it.
So just search simulation

132
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:07,840
So just search simulation
 

133
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,550
So just search simulation
and we're going to go ahead and plug

134
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:10,560
and we're going to go ahead and plug
 

135
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,030
and we're going to go ahead and plug
these here. So what we want to do

136
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,040
these here. So what we want to do
 

137
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,430
these here. So what we want to do
is simulate a movement. And what I want

138
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:17,440
is simulate a movement. And what I want
 

139
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,350
is simulate a movement. And what I want
to do is get a transform geometry. And I

140
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:21,360
to do is get a transform geometry. And I
 

141
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,270
to do is get a transform geometry. And I
want to simulate it going this

142
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:23,280
want to simulate it going this
 

143
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,949
want to simulate it going this
direction. And what a simulation is

144
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:24,959
direction. And what a simulation is
 

145
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,589
direction. And what a simulation is
going to do is repeat an action every

146
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:27,599
going to do is repeat an action every
 

147
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,070
going to do is repeat an action every
single frame. And so what I want to do

148
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:30,080
single frame. And so what I want to do
 

149
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,750
single frame. And so what I want to do
is to go 01, duplicate another one at

150
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:33,760
is to go 01, duplicate another one at
 

151
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,550
is to go 01, duplicate another one at
that distance every frame. And so what

152
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:36,560
that distance every frame. And so what
 

153
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,630
that distance every frame. And so what
we need to do is get a join geometry

154
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:38,640
we need to do is get a join geometry
 

155
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,270
we need to do is get a join geometry
node. And then we we're just going to go

156
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:41,280
node. And then we we're just going to go
 

157
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,589
node. And then we we're just going to go
ahead from outside of the simulation

158
00:02:43,589 --> 00:02:43,599
ahead from outside of the simulation
 

159
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,750
ahead from outside of the simulation
zone do that. Now make sure you're not

160
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:47,760
zone do that. Now make sure you're not
 

161
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,470
zone do that. Now make sure you're not
doing this. That's going to in be insane

162
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:50,480
doing this. That's going to in be insane
 

163
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,229
doing this. That's going to in be insane
for your computer. We want to go outside

164
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:52,239
for your computer. We want to go outside
 

165
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,270
for your computer. We want to go outside
of it. Otherwise, it's going to be

166
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:53,280
of it. Otherwise, it's going to be
 

167
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,750
of it. Otherwise, it's going to be
duplicating geometry way too much. So,

168
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:55,760
duplicating geometry way too much. So,
 

169
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,830
duplicating geometry way too much. So,
now that we have this, if I press play,

170
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:57,840
now that we have this, if I press play,
 

171
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,150
now that we have this, if I press play,
we're now getting an array. Now, the way

172
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:00,160
we're now getting an array. Now, the way
 

173
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,949
we're now getting an array. Now, the way
that I used to do this is to get a a

174
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:02,959
that I used to do this is to get a a
 

175
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,830
that I used to do this is to get a a
line and then instance objects on the

176
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:05,840
line and then instance objects on the
 

177
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,670
line and then instance objects on the
points of that line. The problem is when

178
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:07,680
points of that line. The problem is when
 

179
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,430
points of that line. The problem is when
I want to go ahead and displace the

180
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:09,440
I want to go ahead and displace the
 

181
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,350
I want to go ahead and displace the
curves that are instance on that line,

182
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:11,360
curves that are instance on that line,
 

183
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,910
curves that are instance on that line,
it displaces the line, not the curves on

184
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:13,920
it displaces the line, not the curves on
 

185
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,390
it displaces the line, not the curves on
the line. Hope that makes sense. This

186
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:16,400
the line. Hope that makes sense. This
 

187
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,710
the line. Hope that makes sense. This
goes around it and offers some really,

188
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:18,720
goes around it and offers some really,
 

189
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,030
goes around it and offers some really,
really cool things that I dived into on

190
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:21,040
really cool things that I dived into on
 

191
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,710
really cool things that I dived into on
Patreon. So, a lot of really cool things

192
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:22,720
Patreon. So, a lot of really cool things
 

193
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,309
Patreon. So, a lot of really cool things
to explore just with the simple idea

194
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:24,319
to explore just with the simple idea
 

195
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,710
to explore just with the simple idea
with simulations. Now, with me, you can

196
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:26,720
with simulations. Now, with me, you can
 

197
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,470
with simulations. Now, with me, you can
see I have 46 frames. That means I have

198
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:28,480
see I have 46 frames. That means I have
 

199
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,910
see I have 46 frames. That means I have
46 objects. I want to get about 38.

200
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:31,920
46 objects. I want to get about 38.
 

201
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,110
46 objects. I want to get about 38.
And then we can

202
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,120
And then we can
 

203
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,910
And then we can
we can bake this in just like that. And

204
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:37,920
we can bake this in just like that. And
 

205
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,509
we can bake this in just like that. And
it's going to tell you we have baked

206
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:39,519
it's going to tell you we have baked
 

207
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,350
it's going to tell you we have baked
frame 38. In this case, that means we

208
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:41,360
frame 38. In this case, that means we
 

209
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,750
frame 38. In this case, that means we
have 38 instances. Now, what I want to

210
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:43,760
have 38 instances. Now, what I want to
 

211
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,190
have 38 instances. Now, what I want to
do is get another transform geometry and

212
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:47,200
do is get another transform geometry and
 

213
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,309
do is get another transform geometry and
just bring this guy to the center as

214
00:03:50,309 --> 00:03:50,319
just bring this guy to the center as
 

215
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,390
just bring this guy to the center as
well. Again, not necessary. It's really

216
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:52,400
well. Again, not necessary. It's really
 

217
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,550
well. Again, not necessary. It's really
just for me. Um, now let's go ahead and

218
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:56,560
just for me. Um, now let's go ahead and
 

219
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,670
just for me. Um, now let's go ahead and
displace this. So, we're going to get a

220
00:03:59,670 --> 00:03:59,680
displace this. So, we're going to get a
 

221
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,990
displace this. So, we're going to get a
set position node and we're going to get

222
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,000
set position node and we're going to get
 

223
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,110
set position node and we're going to get
a noise texture. So, what I want is to

224
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,120
a noise texture. So, what I want is to
 

225
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,030
a noise texture. So, what I want is to
displace it only on the X. So, we need

226
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,040
displace it only on the X. So, we need
 

227
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,350
displace it only on the X. So, we need
to get a combine

228
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:09,360
to get a combine
 

229
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,470
to get a combine
XYZ node which will allow us to now have

230
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:12,480
XYZ node which will allow us to now have
 

231
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,990
XYZ node which will allow us to now have
access to one single axis. Plug factor

232
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,000
access to one single axis. Plug factor
 

233
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,830
access to one single axis. Plug factor
into Z. And then I'm going to use the

234
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:17,840
into Z. And then I'm going to use the
 

235
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,590
into Z. And then I'm going to use the
normalize. Notice how it kind of went

236
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:19,600
normalize. Notice how it kind of went
 

237
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,069
normalize. Notice how it kind of went
above. Normalize will keep it centered.

238
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:22,079
above. Normalize will keep it centered.
 

239
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,550
above. Normalize will keep it centered.
But now this is far far too strong. So

240
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:24,560
But now this is far far too strong. So
 

241
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,550
But now this is far far too strong. So
we can use a math node to edit the

242
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:28,560
we can use a math node to edit the
 

243
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,990
we can use a math node to edit the
strength of this effect with the

244
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,000
strength of this effect with the
 

245
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,950
strength of this effect with the
multiply function. Multiply is going to

246
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:32,960
multiply function. Multiply is going to
 

247
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,870
multiply function. Multiply is going to
play with the strength of a particular

248
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:34,880
play with the strength of a particular
 

249
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,590
play with the strength of a particular
action. So now we can bring the detail

250
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:37,600
action. So now we can bring the detail
 

251
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,510
action. So now we can bring the detail
down to zero. We can bring that scale

252
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:39,520
down to zero. We can bring that scale
 

253
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,110
down to zero. We can bring that scale
up. Actually, maybe bring the detail a

254
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,120
up. Actually, maybe bring the detail a
 

255
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,110
up. Actually, maybe bring the detail a
little bit up. And then switch this over

256
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:43,120
little bit up. And then switch this over
 

257
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,629
little bit up. And then switch this over
to 4D. And we can look at that movement.

258
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:46,639
to 4D. And we can look at that movement.
 

259
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,350
to 4D. And we can look at that movement.
There is one thing that I don't

260
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:49,360
There is one thing that I don't
 

261
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,350
There is one thing that I don't
particularly like with this idea. Notice

262
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:53,360
particularly like with this idea. Notice
 

263
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,030
particularly like with this idea. Notice
how all of the strings are kind of all

264
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,040
how all of the strings are kind of all
 

265
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,950
how all of the strings are kind of all
the strings are being affected by the

266
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:58,960
the strings are being affected by the
 

267
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,990
the strings are being affected by the
same exact noise texture, specifically

268
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,000
same exact noise texture, specifically
 

269
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,629
same exact noise texture, specifically
the same value of the W. All these

270
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:04,639
the same value of the W. All these
 

271
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,550
the same value of the W. All these
things are the same, right? And so the

272
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:06,560
things are the same, right? And so the
 

273
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,189
things are the same, right? And so the
value of the W is like a seed value, but

274
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:09,199
value of the W is like a seed value, but
 

275
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,710
value of the W is like a seed value, but
all of them are being animated. So they

276
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:10,720
all of them are being animated. So they
 

277
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,629
all of them are being animated. So they
kind of look connected like a like this

278
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:12,639
kind of look connected like a like this
 

279
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,550
kind of look connected like a like this
wave. All of them have this wave this

280
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:14,560
wave. All of them have this wave this
 

281
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,510
wave. All of them have this wave this
way and this way and it's all you know

282
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:17,520
way and this way and it's all you know
 

283
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,550
way and this way and it's all you know
they all look in relation to each other

284
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:20,560
they all look in relation to each other
 

285
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,749
they all look in relation to each other
way in in this wave together that

286
00:05:23,749 --> 00:05:23,759
way in in this wave together that
 

287
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,590
way in in this wave together that
doesn't give this really stringy organic

288
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:27,600
doesn't give this really stringy organic
 

289
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,790
doesn't give this really stringy organic
look that I personally want for this

290
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:30,800
look that I personally want for this
 

291
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,710
look that I personally want for this
which means I want each one of these

292
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:32,720
which means I want each one of these
 

293
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,629
which means I want each one of these
strings to have its own value of the W.

294
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:36,639
strings to have its own value of the W.
 

295
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,270
strings to have its own value of the W.
So say like this string is on this value

296
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:39,280
So say like this string is on this value
 

297
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,270
So say like this string is on this value
2.48 48 and another string is going to

298
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:41,280
2.48 48 and another string is going to
 

299
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,189
2.48 48 and another string is going to
have this value which will put them at

300
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:43,199
have this value which will put them at
 

301
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,390
have this value which will put them at
random points which is what I want. Now

302
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:46,400
random points which is what I want. Now
 

303
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,710
random points which is what I want. Now
how do you do that? I'm going to go

304
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:48,720
how do you do that? I'm going to go
 

305
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,950
how do you do that? I'm going to go
ahead and give myself a little bit more

306
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:50,960
ahead and give myself a little bit more
 

307
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,710
ahead and give myself a little bit more
space here and we're going to get an

308
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:52,720
space here and we're going to get an
 

309
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,270
space here and we're going to get an
attribute. So we're going to get a store

310
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:55,280
attribute. So we're going to get a store
 

311
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,830
attribute. So we're going to get a store
named attribute node. We're going to get

312
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:57,840
named attribute node. We're going to get
 

313
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,629
named attribute node. We're going to get
a random value and we want to use a

314
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:00,639
a random value and we want to use a
 

315
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,990
a random value and we want to use a
random value for the W giving each one

316
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:04,000
random value for the W giving each one
 

317
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,189
random value for the W giving each one
of these strings its own random W value.

318
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:07,199
of these strings its own random W value.
 

319
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,870
of these strings its own random W value.
How do you do that? So here in the store

320
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:08,880
How do you do that? So here in the store
 

321
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,390
How do you do that? So here in the store
named attribute, I want it to recognize

322
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:10,400
named attribute, I want it to recognize
 

323
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,390
named attribute, I want it to recognize
the splines. We're just going to give it

324
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:12,400
the splines. We're just going to give it
 

325
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,150
the splines. We're just going to give it
a name of R just for random. And you can

326
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,160
a name of R just for random. And you can
 

327
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,909
a name of R just for random. And you can
plug this right here. So now that we

328
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:15,919
plug this right here. So now that we
 

329
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,309
plug this right here. So now that we
have an attribute that is assigning a a

330
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:18,319
have an attribute that is assigning a a
 

331
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,469
have an attribute that is assigning a a
unique value to each one of these

332
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:20,479
unique value to each one of these
 

333
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,950
unique value to each one of these
strings cuz it recognizes each one of

334
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:22,960
strings cuz it recognizes each one of
 

335
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,950
strings cuz it recognizes each one of
those curves through telling it to

336
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:24,960
those curves through telling it to
 

337
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,870
those curves through telling it to
recognize curves and assign a random

338
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:26,880
recognize curves and assign a random
 

339
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,469
recognize curves and assign a random
value to each one of those curves.

340
00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:28,479
value to each one of those curves.
 

341
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,629
value to each one of those curves.
That's what this does. So now we can get

342
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:30,639
That's what this does. So now we can get
 

343
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,749
That's what this does. So now we can get
a attribute node, a named attribute

344
00:06:33,749 --> 00:06:33,759
a attribute node, a named attribute
 

345
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,990
a attribute node, a named attribute
call. Looks like it's a capital R. I

346
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,000
call. Looks like it's a capital R. I
 

347
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,469
call. Looks like it's a capital R. I
don't know why I did a capital. And then

348
00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:38,479
don't know why I did a capital. And then
 

349
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,790
don't know why I did a capital. And then
watch what happens if I go ahead and

350
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:40,800
watch what happens if I go ahead and
 

351
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,029
watch what happens if I go ahead and
plug this attribute into the W. Instead

352
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:43,039
plug this attribute into the W. Instead
 

353
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,270
plug this attribute into the W. Instead
of now just one value, we're getting

354
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:45,280
of now just one value, we're getting
 

355
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,070
of now just one value, we're getting
multiple values in the W. And this is

356
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,080
multiple values in the W. And this is
 

357
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,909
multiple values in the W. And this is
awesome. Two things. We can't adjust the

358
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:51,919
awesome. Two things. We can't adjust the
 

359
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,710
awesome. Two things. We can't adjust the
strength of this effect. And we also no

360
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:54,720
strength of this effect. And we also no
 

361
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,469
strength of this effect. And we also no
longer have an ability to animate the W.

362
00:06:56,469 --> 00:06:56,479
longer have an ability to animate the W.
 

363
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,070
longer have an ability to animate the W.
But we could fix that with a math node

364
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,080
But we could fix that with a math node
 

365
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,270
But we could fix that with a math node
right here. So if you play with add, if

366
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:01,280
right here. So if you play with add, if
 

367
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,510
right here. So if you play with add, if
you just want to animate, the add

368
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:03,520
you just want to animate, the add
 

369
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,870
you just want to animate, the add
function right here is exactly

370
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:06,880
function right here is exactly
 

371
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,110
function right here is exactly
the W slider. See that? It does the same

372
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:09,120
the W slider. See that? It does the same
 

373
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,469
the W slider. See that? It does the same
exact thing, but in case we now have

374
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:10,479
exact thing, but in case we now have
 

375
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,749
exact thing, but in case we now have
access to it. So now it's randomly uh

376
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:13,759
access to it. So now it's randomly uh
 

377
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,670
access to it. So now it's randomly uh
animating the W of all these random

378
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:15,680
animating the W of all these random
 

379
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,589
animating the W of all these random
values. But what we can do is actually

380
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:17,599
values. But what we can do is actually
 

381
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,909
values. But what we can do is actually
get a multiply add node. And if you

382
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:19,919
get a multiply add node. And if you
 

383
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,990
get a multiply add node. And if you
bring the multiply to zero, it's like,

384
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:22,000
bring the multiply to zero, it's like,
 

385
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,230
bring the multiply to zero, it's like,
okay, we're no longer random randomizing

386
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:24,240
okay, we're no longer random randomizing
 

387
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,749
okay, we're no longer random randomizing
it. And so you can just kind of bring in

388
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:25,759
it. And so you can just kind of bring in
 

389
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,029
it. And so you can just kind of bring in
a little bit of randomization. So it

390
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:29,039
a little bit of randomization. So it
 

391
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,390
a little bit of randomization. So it
still looks like they're all kind of a

392
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:30,400
still looks like they're all kind of a
 

393
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,790
still looks like they're all kind of a
part of this big wave, but they still

394
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:32,800
part of this big wave, but they still
 

395
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,110
part of this big wave, but they still
have a little bit of individuality to

396
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,120
have a little bit of individuality to
 

397
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,629
have a little bit of individuality to
them. Or you can kind of go crazy with

398
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:36,639
them. Or you can kind of go crazy with
 

399
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,230
them. Or you can kind of go crazy with
it and have them all just look like

400
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:38,240
it and have them all just look like
 

401
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,990
it and have them all just look like
they're doing their own thing. I do kind

402
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:40,000
they're doing their own thing. I do kind
 

403
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,589
they're doing their own thing. I do kind
of like a mix of this and that, giving

404
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:43,599
of like a mix of this and that, giving
 

405
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,749
of like a mix of this and that, giving
it just a little bit of this organic

406
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:45,759
it just a little bit of this organic
 

407
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,270
it just a little bit of this organic
stringy motion, but they're all kind of

408
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:47,280
stringy motion, but they're all kind of
 

409
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,670
stringy motion, but they're all kind of
wave and a wave together in this kind of

410
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:49,680
wave and a wave together in this kind of
 

411
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,110
wave and a wave together in this kind of
interesting way. We're going to go ahead

412
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,120
interesting way. We're going to go ahead
 

413
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,350
interesting way. We're going to go ahead
and isolate this uh displacement. But

414
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:53,360
and isolate this uh displacement. But
 

415
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,469
and isolate this uh displacement. But
first, I kind of want to look at some

416
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:54,479
first, I kind of want to look at some
 

417
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,230
first, I kind of want to look at some
geometry to make it look better. So,

418
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:56,240
geometry to make it look better. So,
 

419
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,990
geometry to make it look better. So,
we're going to go ahead and get a curve

420
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:58,000
we're going to go ahead and get a curve
 

421
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,990
we're going to go ahead and get a curve
to mesh

422
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,000

 

423
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,909

and we're going to get a curve circle

424
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:03,919
and we're going to get a curve circle
 

425
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,510
and we're going to get a curve circle
for the geometry. So, I'm going to give

426
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:05,520
for the geometry. So, I'm going to give
 

427
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,029
for the geometry. So, I'm going to give
it a radius of 0.4 and plug curve into

428
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:09,039
it a radius of 0.4 and plug curve into
 

429
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,550
it a radius of 0.4 and plug curve into
profile. Now, we have our strings and we

430
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:12,560
profile. Now, we have our strings and we
 

431
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,150
profile. Now, we have our strings and we
can go back and kind of look at how that

432
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:16,160
can go back and kind of look at how that
 

433
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,510
can go back and kind of look at how that
looks. It looks really cool and I love

434
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:17,520
looks. It looks really cool and I love
 

435
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,029
looks. It looks really cool and I love
it. So, what I want to do is just have

436
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:21,039
it. So, what I want to do is just have
 

437
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,749
it. So, what I want to do is just have
the displacement centered right here to

438
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:23,759
the displacement centered right here to
 

439
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,029
the displacement centered right here to
the middle. So, we're going to go ahead

440
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:25,039
the middle. So, we're going to go ahead
 

441
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,230
the middle. So, we're going to go ahead
and mix two things. We're going to mix a

442
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:28,240
and mix two things. We're going to mix a
 

443
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,230
and mix two things. We're going to mix a
flat

444
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:30,240
flat
 

445
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,709
flat
value and this whole situation here. So,

446
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:32,719
value and this whole situation here. So,
 

447
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,589
value and this whole situation here. So,
what I'm going to do is going to mix

448
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:35,599
what I'm going to do is going to mix
 

449
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,509
what I'm going to do is going to mix
vector. Now, we could use vector if we

450
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:37,519
vector. Now, we could use vector if we
 

451
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,589
vector. Now, we could use vector if we
want. Uh, these are floats, so we're

452
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:39,599
want. Uh, these are floats, so we're
 

453
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,110
want. Uh, these are floats, so we're
just going to use mix float just to keep

454
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:41,120
just going to use mix float just to keep
 

455
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,389
just going to use mix float just to keep
it all uh technically correct, but the

456
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:44,399
it all uh technically correct, but the
 

457
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,750
it all uh technically correct, but the
the vector would work, too.

458
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:47,760
the vector would work, too.
 

459
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,790
the vector would work, too.
Now, we're going to mix this state with

460
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:50,800
Now, we're going to mix this state with
 

461
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,030
Now, we're going to mix this state with
this state, and we're going to do that

462
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,040
this state, and we're going to do that
 

463
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,190
this state, and we're going to do that
with the factor. So, what we can do, I'm

464
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:55,200
with the factor. So, what we can do, I'm
 

465
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,310
with the factor. So, what we can do, I'm
just bring this down here.

466
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:58,320
just bring this down here.
 

467
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,910
just bring this down here.
We're going to get a position node, and

468
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:01,920
We're going to get a position node, and
 

469
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,710
We're going to get a position node, and
we're going to get a math node. I'm

470
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:04,720
we're going to get a math node. I'm
 

471
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,230
we're going to get a math node. I'm
going to plug position into value and

472
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:06,240
going to plug position into value and
 

473
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,470
going to plug position into value and
value into factor. And it's going to do

474
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:08,480
value into factor. And it's going to do
 

475
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,590
value into factor. And it's going to do
this. If I play with the value,

476
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:11,600
this. If I play with the value,
 

477
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,790
this. If I play with the value,
you can notice

478
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:14,800
you can notice
 

479
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,550
you can notice
it's animating in. It's animating this

480
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:16,560
it's animating in. It's animating this
 

481
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,870
it's animating in. It's animating this
dis this displacement in. Now, one thing

482
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:18,880
dis this displacement in. Now, one thing
 

483
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,949
dis this displacement in. Now, one thing
I want to do is make sure any effect I

484
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:20,959
I want to do is make sure any effect I
 

485
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,470
I want to do is make sure any effect I
do is actually moving this direction.

486
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:24,480
do is actually moving this direction.
 

487
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,710
do is actually moving this direction.
So, what we're going to do is get a

488
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:26,720
So, what we're going to do is get a
 

489
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,790
So, what we're going to do is get a
separate XYZ

490
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:28,800
separate XYZ
 

491
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,710
separate XYZ
and

492
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:30,720
and
 

493
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,870
and
confine it to the Y. Because if I play

494
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:32,880
confine it to the Y. Because if I play
 

495
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,190
confine it to the Y. Because if I play
with the value now, you can see it's

496
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:35,200
with the value now, you can see it's
 

497
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,590
with the value now, you can see it's
going the other direction from left to

498
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:37,600
going the other direction from left to
 

499
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,829
going the other direction from left to
right. So, I wanted to make sure because

500
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:39,839
right. So, I wanted to make sure because
 

501
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,790
right. So, I wanted to make sure because
once we add our pingpong function, it is

502
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:42,800
once we add our pingpong function, it is
 

503
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,670
once we add our pingpong function, it is
going to

504
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:45,680
going to
 

505
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,750
going to
need to be told which way to go. So, now

506
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:47,760
need to be told which way to go. So, now
 

507
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,350
need to be told which way to go. So, now
we have this really cool function which

508
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:49,360
we have this really cool function which
 

509
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,269
we have this really cool function which
you can also animate automatically. This

510
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:51,279
you can also animate automatically. This
 

511
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,350
you can also animate automatically. This
is really cool and fun. So, we have this

512
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:53,360
is really cool and fun. So, we have this
 

513
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,949
is really cool and fun. So, we have this
and now we're going to go ahead and add

514
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:54,959
and now we're going to go ahead and add
 

515
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,389
and now we're going to go ahead and add
in a pingpong function to make sure that

516
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:58,399
in a pingpong function to make sure that
 

517
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,030
in a pingpong function to make sure that
we can go from displacement flat

518
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:01,040
we can go from displacement flat
 

519
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,710
we can go from displacement flat
essentially go flat displacement flat.

520
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:02,720
essentially go flat displacement flat.
 

521
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,150
essentially go flat displacement flat.
And that is a ping-pong function if

522
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,160
And that is a ping-pong function if
 

523
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,190
And that is a ping-pong function if
you're going one back to another. And so

524
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:07,200
you're going one back to another. And so
 

525
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,790
you're going one back to another. And so
we're going to go ahead and get another

526
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:08,800
we're going to go ahead and get another
 

527
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,750
we're going to go ahead and get another
math node and we're going to get D, if

528
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:13,760
math node and we're going to get D, if
 

529
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,670
math node and we're going to get D, if
we can find it, ping pong. So if I bring

530
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:15,680
we can find it, ping pong. So if I bring
 

531
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,670
we can find it, ping pong. So if I bring
that value up, you'll notice,

532
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:19,680
that value up, you'll notice,
 

533
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,910
that value up, you'll notice,
bring that value into the negative, it's

534
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:21,920
bring that value into the negative, it's
 

535
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,550
bring that value into the negative, it's
going to kind of isolate this. And so we

536
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:24,560
going to kind of isolate this. And so we
 

537
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,230
going to kind of isolate this. And so we
can just bring this guy to the center

538
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:26,240
can just bring this guy to the center
 

539
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,030
can just bring this guy to the center
with our value. But notice what this

540
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,040
with our value. But notice what this
 

541
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,670
with our value. But notice what this
ping pong is doing. So it is doing a lot

542
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:31,680
ping pong is doing. So it is doing a lot
 

543
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,190
ping pong is doing. So it is doing a lot
of like multiple ping pongs, which just

544
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:33,200
of like multiple ping pongs, which just
 

545
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,230
of like multiple ping pongs, which just
makes it look regular. um bring that to

546
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:36,240
makes it look regular. um bring that to
 

547
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,550
makes it look regular. um bring that to
a larger negative value. And now what

548
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:38,560
a larger negative value. And now what
 

549
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,389
a larger negative value. And now what
it's taking is flat going to

550
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:40,399
it's taking is flat going to
 

551
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,470
it's taking is flat going to
displacement and then going back to

552
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:42,480
displacement and then going back to
 

553
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,350
displacement and then going back to
flat. That's what this function is doing

554
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:45,360
flat. That's what this function is doing
 

555
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,990
flat. That's what this function is doing
in a really sort of layman's turn term

556
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,000
in a really sort of layman's turn term
 

557
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,870
in a really sort of layman's turn term
way. So what we can do now is we can get

558
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:50,880
way. So what we can do now is we can get
 

559
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,670
way. So what we can do now is we can get
another math node

560
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:53,680
another math node
 

561
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,310
another math node
to edit the size

562
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:58,320
to edit the size
 

563
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,750
to edit the size
of this ping pong function. So this add

564
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:01,760
of this ping pong function. So this add
 

565
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,710
of this ping pong function. So this add
function plays with the position of

566
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:04,720
function plays with the position of
 

567
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,030
function plays with the position of
where it's happening and this plays with

568
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,040
where it's happening and this plays with
 

569
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,350
where it's happening and this plays with
the size which opens up an ability to

570
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:09,360
the size which opens up an ability to
 

571
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,829
the size which opens up an ability to
actually animate it coming in. So I want

572
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:11,839
actually animate it coming in. So I want
 

573
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,910
actually animate it coming in. So I want
to isolate it to somewhere around there.

574
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:13,920
to isolate it to somewhere around there.
 

575
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,829
to isolate it to somewhere around there.
And then you can play with your multiply

576
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:15,839
And then you can play with your multiply
 

577
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,630
And then you can play with your multiply
down here to say how strong you want

578
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:18,640
down here to say how strong you want
 

579
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,190
down here to say how strong you want
that effect. And then you can animate it

580
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:23,200
that effect. And then you can animate it
 

581
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,509
that effect. And then you can animate it
right here. And it's really really

582
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:25,519
right here. And it's really really
 

583
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,350
right here. And it's really really
controllable and fun. So that's the

584
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:27,360
controllable and fun. So that's the
 

585
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,630
controllable and fun. So that's the
first animation. You can just go ahead

586
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:30,640
first animation. You can just go ahead
 

587
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,710
first animation. You can just go ahead
do that if you want. Now, I'm going to

588
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:32,720
do that if you want. Now, I'm going to
 

589
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,030
do that if you want. Now, I'm going to
bring this all the way to the to the I'm

590
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,040
bring this all the way to the to the I'm
 

591
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,069
bring this all the way to the to the I'm
going to bring this one all the way out

592
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:36,079
going to bring this one all the way out
 

593
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,230
going to bring this one all the way out
so we can see all the displacement. What

594
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:38,240
so we can see all the displacement. What
 

595
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,150
so we can see all the displacement. What
we can also do is trim it. So, what I

596
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:42,160
we can also do is trim it. So, what I
 

597
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,350
we can also do is trim it. So, what I
can do is I'm going to just bring these

598
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:43,360
can do is I'm going to just bring these
 

599
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,069
can do is I'm going to just bring these
guys over here and get a trim curves

600
00:11:48,069 --> 00:11:48,079

 

601
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,710

node. And if you play with the end,

602
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:50,720
node. And if you play with the end,
 

603
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,550
node. And if you play with the end,
notice

604
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:52,560
notice
 

605
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,630
notice
you can animate these guys actually

606
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:54,640
you can animate these guys actually
 

607
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,470
you can animate these guys actually
coming in. Now, notice these are hollow.

608
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:58,480
coming in. Now, notice these are hollow.
 

609
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,110
coming in. Now, notice these are hollow.
If you go here to the uh curve to mesh,

610
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:01,120
If you go here to the uh curve to mesh,
 

611
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,670
If you go here to the uh curve to mesh,
it'll fill that up. But it's pretty

612
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:03,680
it'll fill that up. But it's pretty
 

613
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,470
it'll fill that up. But it's pretty
cool. We can now animate this in. But

614
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:06,480
cool. We can now animate this in. But
 

615
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,110
cool. We can now animate this in. But
what's not cool, at least with the style

616
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:09,120
what's not cool, at least with the style
 

617
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,110
what's not cool, at least with the style
that I want, is that just it's just like

618
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:11,120
that I want, is that just it's just like
 

619
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,870
that I want, is that just it's just like
you took scissors and cut it. I want to

620
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:12,880
you took scissors and cut it. I want to
 

621
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,870
you took scissors and cut it. I want to
randomize

622
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:14,880
randomize
 

623
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,550
randomize
um where they're at. And you could do

624
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:16,560
um where they're at. And you could do
 

625
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,790
um where they're at. And you could do
that with a

626
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:18,800
that with a
 

627
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,870
that with a
random value. Just plug a random value

628
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:20,880
random value. Just plug a random value
 

629
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,949
random value. Just plug a random value
into the end function. And let's just

630
00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:22,959
into the end function. And let's just
 

631
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,870
into the end function. And let's just
give them both a value of zero and

632
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:24,880
give them both a value of zero and
 

633
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,910
give them both a value of zero and
animate it in. So, see that? You just

634
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:27,920
animate it in. So, see that? You just
 

635
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,509
animate it in. So, see that? You just
click and drag if you want them both to

636
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:29,519
click and drag if you want them both to
 

637
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,269
click and drag if you want them both to
go together. And then I'll just pull one

638
00:12:31,269 --> 00:12:31,279
go together. And then I'll just pull one
 

639
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,269
go together. And then I'll just pull one
back.

640
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:33,279
back.
 

641
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,550
back.
And now you have a little bit more of a

642
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:36,560
And now you have a little bit more of a
 

643
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,389
And now you have a little bit more of a
natural look. And then if you click and

644
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:38,399
natural look. And then if you click and
 

645
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,629
natural look. And then if you click and
drag them both, they'll just travel

646
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:40,639
drag them both, they'll just travel
 

647
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,389
drag them both, they'll just travel
together. And now we have a really,

648
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:44,399
together. And now we have a really,
 

649
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,670
together. And now we have a really,
really cool thing. So there you have

650
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:47,680
really cool thing. So there you have
 

651
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,110
really cool thing. So there you have
that. I'm going to give them a value of

652
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:49,120
that. I'm going to give them a value of
 

653
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,150
that. I'm going to give them a value of
one. And I'm going to go back to uh this

654
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:52,160
one. And I'm going to go back to uh this
 

655
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,710
one. And I'm going to go back to uh this
effect. I'm going to go ahead and add

656
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:54,720
effect. I'm going to go ahead and add
 

657
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,190
effect. I'm going to go ahead and add
our lighting. and all that stuff uh with

658
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:57,200
our lighting. and all that stuff uh with
 

659
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,990
our lighting. and all that stuff uh with
this this look. This is my favorite look

660
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:00,000
this this look. This is my favorite look
 

661
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,470
this this look. This is my favorite look
of the two, but both animations I can

662
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:02,480
of the two, but both animations I can
 

663
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,389
of the two, but both animations I can
see, you know, people wanting and I

664
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:04,399
see, you know, people wanting and I
 

665
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,550
see, you know, people wanting and I
wanted to show you guys you could do uh

666
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:06,560
wanted to show you guys you could do uh
 

667
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,990
wanted to show you guys you could do uh
multiple things here. So, now we have

668
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:10,000
multiple things here. So, now we have
 

669
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,069
multiple things here. So, now we have
this really cool effect. So, I think I'm

670
00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:12,079
this really cool effect. So, I think I'm
 

671
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,150
this really cool effect. So, I think I'm
ready to go ahead and add a camera, add

672
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:14,160
ready to go ahead and add a camera, add
 

673
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,030
ready to go ahead and add a camera, add
some lighting, have a little bit of of

674
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:17,040
some lighting, have a little bit of of
 

675
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,110
some lighting, have a little bit of of
fun with it.

676
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:19,120
fun with it.
 

677
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,870
fun with it.
Just making some adjustments personally.

678
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:20,880
Just making some adjustments personally.
 

679
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,230
Just making some adjustments personally.
Okay, let's go ahead and add a material

680
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:24,240
Okay, let's go ahead and add a material
 

681
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,150
Okay, let's go ahead and add a material
to this. So, I'm going to go here to the

682
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,160
to this. So, I'm going to go here to the
 

683
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,430
to this. So, I'm going to go here to the
end, get a

684
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:29,440
end, get a
 

685
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,310
end, get a
set material node. And before we switch

686
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:32,320
set material node. And before we switch
 

687
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,389
set material node. And before we switch
over to the shading, I do Let's go ahead

688
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:34,399
over to the shading, I do Let's go ahead
 

689
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,550
over to the shading, I do Let's go ahead
and create a material. Before we switch

690
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:36,560
and create a material. Before we switch
 

691
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,790
and create a material. Before we switch
over to the shading, I want to remind

692
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:38,800
over to the shading, I want to remind
 

693
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,949
over to the shading, I want to remind
you we have an attribute over here that

694
00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:40,959
you we have an attribute over here that
 

695
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,110
you we have an attribute over here that
creates a random value. So, just

696
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:43,120
creates a random value. So, just
 

697
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,230
creates a random value. So, just
remember that because we are going to

698
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:44,240
remember that because we are going to
 

699
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,710
remember that because we are going to
use that in just a second um in the

700
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:46,720
use that in just a second um in the
 

701
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,150
use that in just a second um in the
shading. So, there's nothing I want to

702
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:48,160
shading. So, there's nothing I want to
 

703
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,750
shading. So, there's nothing I want to
do in this window right now. So, I'm

704
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:49,760
do in this window right now. So, I'm
 

705
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,790
do in this window right now. So, I'm
just going to go ahead and switch it

706
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:50,800
just going to go ahead and switch it
 

707
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,870
just going to go ahead and switch it
over to the shader editor. And now we

708
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:52,880
over to the shader editor. And now we
 

709
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,190
over to the shader editor. And now we
have that material material 001. You can

710
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:55,200
have that material material 001. You can
 

711
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,350
have that material material 001. You can
see we're using it by seeing that up

712
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:57,360
see we're using it by seeing that up
 

713
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,829
see we're using it by seeing that up
there. So first let's get that attribute

714
00:13:59,829 --> 00:13:59,839
there. So first let's get that attribute
 

715
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,269
there. So first let's get that attribute
node and I'm going to switch this over

716
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:01,279
node and I'm going to switch this over
 

717
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,670
node and I'm going to switch this over
to the material preview.

718
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:03,680
to the material preview.
 

719
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,310
to the material preview.
If I plug So if I type in the letter R,

720
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:06,320
If I plug So if I type in the letter R,
 

721
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,310
If I plug So if I type in the letter R,
which is going to call that attribute

722
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:08,320
which is going to call that attribute
 

723
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,470
which is going to call that attribute
that we called to create the randomness,

724
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:10,480
that we called to create the randomness,
 

725
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,069
that we called to create the randomness,
and we plug factor right into base

726
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:12,079
and we plug factor right into base
 

727
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,030
and we plug factor right into base
color, we can see it's actually creating

728
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:15,040
color, we can see it's actually creating
 

729
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,870
color, we can see it's actually creating
a little bit of randomness, random

730
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:16,880
a little bit of randomness, random
 

731
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,629
a little bit of randomness, random
color, which is great. That's what I

732
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:18,639
color, which is great. That's what I
 

733
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,269
color, which is great. That's what I
want. Um, in this particular style,

734
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:21,279
want. Um, in this particular style,
 

735
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,949
want. Um, in this particular style,
we're just making it look cool with some

736
00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:22,959
we're just making it look cool with some
 

737
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,790
we're just making it look cool with some
random color.

738
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:24,800
random color.
 

739
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,150
random color.
So, I'm going to go ahead and get my

740
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,160
So, I'm going to go ahead and get my
 

741
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,069
So, I'm going to go ahead and get my
color ramp. We're going to get two

742
00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:28,079
color ramp. We're going to get two
 

743
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,110
color ramp. We're going to get two
colors. We're going to get kind of a a

744
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:31,120
colors. We're going to get kind of a a
 

745
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,629
colors. We're going to get kind of a a
lightish gray. And then we're also going

746
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:34,639
lightish gray. And then we're also going
 

747
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,790
lightish gray. And then we're also going
to go ahead and get

748
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:38,800

 

749
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,710

something like that. And then we're just

750
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:40,720
something like that. And then we're just
 

751
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,389
something like that. And then we're just
going to bring these two in.

752
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:44,399
going to bring these two in.
 

753
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,030
going to bring these two in.
So, now we have pretty cool style. What

754
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,040
So, now we have pretty cool style. What
 

755
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,470
So, now we have pretty cool style. What
I want to do is I'm going to go here to

756
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:48,480
I want to do is I'm going to go here to
 

757
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,030
I want to do is I'm going to go here to
cycles. Give myself some lights for now.

758
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:51,040
cycles. Give myself some lights for now.
 

759
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,750
cycles. Give myself some lights for now.
And here in the subsurface, I'm going to

760
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:53,760
And here in the subsurface, I'm going to
 

761
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,269
And here in the subsurface, I'm going to
bring that weight up. Now, you can

762
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:55,279
bring that weight up. Now, you can
 

763
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,550
bring that weight up. Now, you can
notice it kind of looks like skin,

764
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:56,560
notice it kind of looks like skin,
 

765
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,829
notice it kind of looks like skin,
especially in the parts where there's

766
00:14:57,829 --> 00:14:57,839
especially in the parts where there's
 

767
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,910
especially in the parts where there's
shadow. That's just cuz these auto these

768
00:14:59,910 --> 00:14:59,920
shadow. That's just cuz these auto these
 

769
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,350
shadow. That's just cuz these auto these
default settings are uh set up for skin.

770
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:03,360
default settings are uh set up for skin.
 

771
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,790
default settings are uh set up for skin.
If you just give them all a value of

772
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:04,800
If you just give them all a value of
 

773
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,590
If you just give them all a value of
one, it'll just make them look normal

774
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:07,600
one, it'll just make them look normal
 

775
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,189
one, it'll just make them look normal
quote unquote normal. It just doesn't

776
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:09,199
quote unquote normal. It just doesn't
 

777
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,790
quote unquote normal. It just doesn't
add that skin kind of look. And then if

778
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:10,800
add that skin kind of look. And then if
 

779
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,269
add that skin kind of look. And then if
you bring that scale up,

780
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:13,279
you bring that scale up,
 

781
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,829
you bring that scale up,
it this scale is what says how much

782
00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:15,839
it this scale is what says how much
 

783
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,990
it this scale is what says how much
light we're letting into this. So this

784
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:18,000
light we're letting into this. So this
 

785
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,910
light we're letting into this. So this
looks really nice. I'm going to go ahead

786
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:19,920
looks really nice. I'm going to go ahead
 

787
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,189
looks really nice. I'm going to go ahead
and park with this and bring this window

788
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:23,199
and park with this and bring this window
 

789
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,629
and park with this and bring this window
over. We're now going to deal with

790
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:24,639
over. We're now going to deal with
 

791
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,069
over. We're now going to deal with
lighting. So I'm going to go and select

792
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:28,079
lighting. So I'm going to go and select
 

793
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,470
lighting. So I'm going to go and select
my camera angle.

794
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:30,480
my camera angle.
 

795
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,629
my camera angle.
Probably something like this. I'm going

796
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:32,639
Probably something like this. I'm going
 

797
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,750
Probably something like this. I'm going
hit control alt0. Snap it to view. And

798
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:35,760
hit control alt0. Snap it to view. And
 

799
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,670
hit control alt0. Snap it to view. And
I'm going to give myself a focal length

800
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:37,680
I'm going to give myself a focal length
 

801
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,030
I'm going to give myself a focal length
focal length of like 120. I want this to

802
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,040
focal length of like 120. I want this to
 

803
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,430
focal length of like 120. I want this to
look really flat

804
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:43,440
look really flat
 

805
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,910
look really flat
in terms of the the the lens

806
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:45,920
in terms of the the the lens
 

807
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:51,829
in terms of the the the lens
essentially. And so maybe something like

808
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:51,839

 

809
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,069

that.

810
00:15:56,069 --> 00:15:56,079

 

811
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,030

Cool. Okay. So, we're going to go ahead

812
00:15:59,030 --> 00:15:59,040
Cool. Okay. So, we're going to go ahead
 

813
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,470
Cool. Okay. So, we're going to go ahead
and add some lighting. So, I'm going to

814
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:00,480
and add some lighting. So, I'm going to
 

815
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,150
and add some lighting. So, I'm going to
bring this down and go just the scene

816
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:02,160
bring this down and go just the scene
 

817
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,949
bring this down and go just the scene
world scene lights. So, we're going to

818
00:16:04,949 --> 00:16:04,959
world scene lights. So, we're going to
 

819
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,030
world scene lights. So, we're going to
get a light hitting it directly that

820
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,040
get a light hitting it directly that
 

821
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,829
get a light hitting it directly that
way. So, let's go ahead and get an area

822
00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:09,839
way. So, let's go ahead and get an area
 

823
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,389
way. So, let's go ahead and get an area
light. I'm going to switch it over to a

824
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:12,399
light. I'm going to switch it over to a
 

825
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,550
light. I'm going to switch it over to a
disc.

826
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:14,560
disc.
 

827
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,350
disc.
Bring it over.

828
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:19,360

 

829
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,430

I'm going hit R twice

830
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:23,440

 

831
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,430

and then bring that give it a power of

832
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:25,440
and then bring that give it a power of
 

833
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,590
and then bring that give it a power of
like I don't know 80. And then we can

834
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:27,600
like I don't know 80. And then we can
 

835
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,150
like I don't know 80. And then we can
bring that spread down

836
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:30,160
bring that spread down
 

837
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,790
bring that spread down
to something around

838
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:32,800
to something around
 

839
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,189
to something around
these lines. And then maybe bring that

840
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:35,199
these lines. And then maybe bring that
 

841
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,350
these lines. And then maybe bring that
power back down a little bit. And then

842
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:37,360
power back down a little bit. And then
 

843
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,670
power back down a little bit. And then
bring that scale up some, too. Okay. So,

844
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:39,680
bring that scale up some, too. Okay. So,
 

845
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,670
bring that scale up some, too. Okay. So,
we kind of have some soft lighting.

846
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:41,680
we kind of have some soft lighting.
 

847
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,350
we kind of have some soft lighting.
Maybe bring that power up. What I want

848
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:43,360
Maybe bring that power up. What I want
 

849
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,069
Maybe bring that power up. What I want
to do, I'm going just turn on my

850
00:16:46,069 --> 00:16:46,079
to do, I'm going just turn on my
 

851
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,150
to do, I'm going just turn on my
denoising. And I want to get a

852
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:48,160
denoising. And I want to get a
 

853
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,990
denoising. And I want to get a
background, a nice soft background. And

854
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:50,000
background, a nice soft background. And
 

855
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,230
background, a nice soft background. And
so, we're going to kind of do it maybe

856
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:52,240
so, we're going to kind of do it maybe
 

857
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,069
so, we're going to kind of do it maybe
not in a totally traditional way. So,

858
00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:54,079
not in a totally traditional way. So,
 

859
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,910
not in a totally traditional way. So,
I'm going to take this. I'm going to do

860
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:55,920
I'm going to take this. I'm going to do
 

861
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,509
I'm going to take this. I'm going to do
RX.

862
00:16:57,509 --> 00:16:57,519
RX.
 

863
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,550
RX.
I'm going hit R Y90.

864
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:00,560
I'm going hit R Y90.
 

865
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,189
I'm going hit R Y90.
And then I want to bring this back far

866
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:03,199
And then I want to bring this back far
 

867
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,710
And then I want to bring this back far
enough to where it can't it can't be

868
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:04,720
enough to where it can't it can't be
 

869
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,270
enough to where it can't it can't be
affected by this light anymore. I want

870
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:07,280
affected by this light anymore. I want
 

871
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,390
affected by this light anymore. I want
to be able to control it uh independent.

872
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:10,400
to be able to control it uh independent.
 

873
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,069
to be able to control it uh independent.
And then I'm going to bring it down to a

874
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:12,079
And then I'm going to bring it down to a
 

875
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:17,270
And then I'm going to bring it down to a
point where we can see it in the camera.

876
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:17,280
point where we can see it in the camera.
 

877
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,949
point where we can see it in the camera.
And then we're going to get a point

878
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:18,959
And then we're going to get a point
 

879
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,829
And then we're going to get a point
light.

880
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:21,839
light.
 

881
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,549
light.
I hit G

882
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:24,559
I hit G
 

883
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,870
I hit G
and just get this point light to be

884
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:26,880
and just get this point light to be
 

885
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,390
and just get this point light to be
affecting

886
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:28,400
affecting
 

887
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,710
affecting
our background. So, I'm gonna get a

888
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:30,720
our background. So, I'm gonna get a
 

889
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,150
our background. So, I'm gonna get a
render region.

890
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:34,160

 

891
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,750

And so, now we can play with this point

892
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:35,760
And so, now we can play with this point
 

893
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,830
And so, now we can play with this point
light

894
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:37,840
light
 

895
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,029
light
to be a nice highlight in the

896
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:41,039
to be a nice highlight in the
 

897
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,029
to be a nice highlight in the
background. And if you want, which I'm

898
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:43,039
background. And if you want, which I'm
 

899
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,630
background. And if you want, which I'm
going to do, I'm going to go over here.

900
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:44,640
going to do, I'm going to go over here.
 

901
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,310
going to do, I'm going to go over here.
I'm going to go back to the shading and

902
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:46,320
I'm going to go back to the shading and
 

903
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,070
I'm going to go back to the shading and
I'm going to hover over here and copy

904
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:48,080
I'm going to hover over here and copy
 

905
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,270
I'm going to hover over here and copy
that color. And then in the point light,

906
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:51,280
that color. And then in the point light,
 

907
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,549
that color. And then in the point light,
I'm going to go ahead and paste that

908
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:52,559
I'm going to go ahead and paste that
 

909
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:53,830
I'm going to go ahead and paste that
color. And then just bring the

910
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:53,840
color. And then just bring the
 

911
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,870
color. And then just bring the
saturation down.

912
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:56,880
saturation down.
 

913
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,510
saturation down.
That's just a good look.

914
00:17:59,510 --> 00:17:59,520
That's just a good look.
 

915
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,870
That's just a good look.
And there we have it. If you want to

916
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:00,880
And there we have it. If you want to
 

917
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,150
And there we have it. If you want to
bring that world brightness down to

918
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:02,160
bring that world brightness down to
 

919
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,590
bring that world brightness down to
black, you can. That's going to give it

920
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:03,600
black, you can. That's going to give it
 

921
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,190
black, you can. That's going to give it
more of a dramatic look, which again

922
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:05,200
more of a dramatic look, which again
 

923
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,870
more of a dramatic look, which again
could be something you want. Then of

924
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:06,880
could be something you want. Then of
 

925
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,070
could be something you want. Then of
course, if you don't like the sort of

926
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:10,080
course, if you don't like the sort of
 

927
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,150
course, if you don't like the sort of
how dramatic these dark shadows are

928
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:12,160
how dramatic these dark shadows are
 

929
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,590
how dramatic these dark shadows are
here, you can add another light, another

930
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:15,600
here, you can add another light, another
 

931
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,150
here, you can add another light, another
area light

932
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:18,160
area light
 

933
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:24,789
area light
down here. just to point at the bottom.

934
00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:24,799

 

935
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,710

And then you can control that.

936
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:28,720
And then you can control that.
 

937
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,350
And then you can control that.
So something like this. There we go. Now

938
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:31,360
So something like this. There we go. Now
 

939
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,710
So something like this. There we go. Now
you have a lot of control. So I'm going

940
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:32,720
you have a lot of control. So I'm going
 

941
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,990
you have a lot of control. So I'm going
to go ahead and render this frame just

942
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:34,000
to go ahead and render this frame just
 

943
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,230
to go ahead and render this frame just
to see how it looks as a final. So this

944
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:36,240
to see how it looks as a final. So this
 

945
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,029
to see how it looks as a final. So this
is our final look. You can play with the

946
00:18:39,029 --> 00:18:39,039
is our final look. You can play with the
 

947
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,390
is our final look. You can play with the
lighting. I mean everything. You can

948
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:40,400
lighting. I mean everything. You can
 

949
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,150
lighting. I mean everything. You can
play with everything to get it to be

950
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:42,160
play with everything to get it to be
 

951
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,390
play with everything to get it to be
exactly how you want it to be. So, I

952
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:44,400
exactly how you want it to be. So, I
 

953
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,630
exactly how you want it to be. So, I
want to go back to geometry nodes just

954
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:46,640
want to go back to geometry nodes just
 

955
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,470
want to go back to geometry nodes just
to show you where you can animate it and

956
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:48,480
to show you where you can animate it and
 

957
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,549
to show you where you can animate it and
just allow you to kind of make that

958
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:50,559
just allow you to kind of make that
 

959
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,070
just allow you to kind of make that
decision for yourself. So, we can go

960
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:52,080
decision for yourself. So, we can go
 

961
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,590
decision for yourself. So, we can go
back to the geometry nodes editor and

962
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:53,600
back to the geometry nodes editor and
 

963
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,110
back to the geometry nodes editor and
look at all of our animation

964
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,120
look at all of our animation
 

965
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,789
look at all of our animation
possibilities.

966
00:18:56,789 --> 00:18:56,799
possibilities.
 

967
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,150
possibilities.
If we go here to this big mix of math,

968
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:00,160
If we go here to this big mix of math,
 

969
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,029
If we go here to this big mix of math,
we have this string of guys up here. You

970
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:03,039
we have this string of guys up here. You
 

971
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,070
we have this string of guys up here. You
can play with this first value node to

972
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,080
can play with this first value node to
 

973
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,070
can play with this first value node to
kind of bring this effect in like that.

974
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:10,080
kind of bring this effect in like that.
 

975
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,630
kind of bring this effect in like that.
Now, if you do that, if you animate from

976
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:12,640
Now, if you do that, if you animate from
 

977
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,950
Now, if you do that, if you animate from
here to here, I would recommend do it

978
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:14,960
here to here, I would recommend do it
 

979
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,110
here to here, I would recommend do it
while simultaneously

980
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:17,120
while simultaneously
 

981
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,669
while simultaneously
animating this W value on the ad end.

982
00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:19,679
animating this W value on the ad end.
 

983
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,510
animating this W value on the ad end.
So, it gives it way more life. So, you

984
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:21,520
So, it gives it way more life. So, you
 

985
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,630
So, it gives it way more life. So, you
can do that. You also have this add node

986
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:24,640
can do that. You also have this add node
 

987
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,990
can do that. You also have this add node
animating this growth

988
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:28,000
animating this growth
 

989
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,549
animating this growth
just like that. And again, if you're

990
00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:30,559
just like that. And again, if you're
 

991
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,029
just like that. And again, if you're
going to do that, I would say have this

992
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:33,039
going to do that, I would say have this
 

993
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,710
going to do that, I would say have this
W value moving while this guy comes in

994
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:36,720
W value moving while this guy comes in
 

995
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,390
W value moving while this guy comes in
and out. And then of course

996
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:40,400
and out. And then of course
 

997
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,909
and out. And then of course
you have this trim curve node.

998
00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:43,919
you have this trim curve node.
 

999
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,990
you have this trim curve node.
You can go ahead and give it a little

1000
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:46,000
You can go ahead and give it a little
 

1001
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,830
You can go ahead and give it a little
bit of randomness.

1002
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:47,840
bit of randomness.
 

1003
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,789
bit of randomness.
And then I would say bring the strength

1004
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:50,799
And then I would say bring the strength
 

1005
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,110
And then I would say bring the strength
down a little bit for this effect. And

1006
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:53,120
down a little bit for this effect. And
 

1007
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,470
down a little bit for this effect. And
then you can play with that trim curves

1008
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:56,480
then you can play with that trim curves
 

1009
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,190
then you can play with that trim curves
to animate in just like that. And this

1010
00:19:59,190 --> 00:19:59,200
to animate in just like that. And this
 

1011
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,950
to animate in just like that. And this
is the one that I would say maybe don't

1012
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:00,960
is the one that I would say maybe don't
 

1013
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,029
is the one that I would say maybe don't
animate the W value. I do like this,

1014
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:05,039
animate the W value. I do like this,
 

1015
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,270
animate the W value. I do like this,
you know, I like how that looks. But

1016
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:07,280
you know, I like how that looks. But
 

1017
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,549
you know, I like how that looks. But
again, it is all completely up to what

1018
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:10,559
again, it is all completely up to what
 

1019
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:11,909
again, it is all completely up to what
you want to do, how you want to animate

1020
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:11,919
you want to do, how you want to animate
 

1021
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,270
you want to do, how you want to animate
it, and I'll leave that completely up to

1022
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:13,280
it, and I'll leave that completely up to
 

1023
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,430
it, and I'll leave that completely up to
you. So, that is how you create this

1024
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:15,440
you. So, that is how you create this
 

1025
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,590
you. So, that is how you create this
string effect. It's really, really

1026
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:17,600
string effect. It's really, really
 

1027
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,510
string effect. It's really, really
powerful. Tons of different ways you can

1028
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:19,520
powerful. Tons of different ways you can
 

1029
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,029
powerful. Tons of different ways you can
do this, controlling the curves, adding

1030
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:21,039
do this, controlling the curves, adding
 

1031
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,710
do this, controlling the curves, adding
textures, adding materials, different

1032
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:22,720
textures, adding materials, different
 

1033
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,950
textures, adding materials, different
context to make this really, really

1034
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:24,960
context to make this really, really
 

1035
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,870
context to make this really, really
useful in your own animations. But with

1036
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:26,880
useful in your own animations. But with
 

1037
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,390
useful in your own animations. But with
that being said, thank you guys for
