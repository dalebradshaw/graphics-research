1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,829

All right, here's the scenario. You've

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:01,839
All right, here's the scenario. You've
 

3
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:03,750
All right, here's the scenario. You've
been watching tutorials for 1, two,

4
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:03,760
been watching tutorials for 1, two,
 

5
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,990
been watching tutorials for 1, two,
maybe three or more years, and now they

6
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:06,000
maybe three or more years, and now they
 

7
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,990
maybe three or more years, and now they
just don't seem to be challenging to you

8
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:08,000
just don't seem to be challenging to you
 

9
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,830
just don't seem to be challenging to you
anymore, or just aren't quite as

10
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:09,840
anymore, or just aren't quite as
 

11
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,589
anymore, or just aren't quite as
interesting as they used to feel. And

12
00:00:11,589 --> 00:00:11,599
interesting as they used to feel. And
 

13
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,110
interesting as they used to feel. And
now you're at a place where you're just

14
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:13,120
now you're at a place where you're just
 

15
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,870
now you're at a place where you're just
not progressing anymore. You know that

16
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:14,880
not progressing anymore. You know that
 

17
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,349
not progressing anymore. You know that
there's a lot more to learn, but you

18
00:00:17,349 --> 00:00:17,359
there's a lot more to learn, but you
 

19
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,269
there's a lot more to learn, but you
can't find it, and tutorials just aren't

20
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:19,279
can't find it, and tutorials just aren't
 

21
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:20,790
can't find it, and tutorials just aren't
offering the things that scratch your

22
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:20,800
offering the things that scratch your
 

23
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,710
offering the things that scratch your
itch. I have found myself in that

24
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:22,720
itch. I have found myself in that
 

25
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,550
itch. I have found myself in that
position before and I want to show you a

26
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:24,560
position before and I want to show you a
 

27
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,269
position before and I want to show you a
technique that I did all of 2024 and it

28
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:27,279
technique that I did all of 2024 and it
 

29
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,390
technique that I did all of 2024 and it
really improved my work and my craft so

30
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:30,400
really improved my work and my craft so
 

31
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,229
really improved my work and my craft so
much. First, I think it's important to

32
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:32,239
much. First, I think it's important to
 

33
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:33,830
much. First, I think it's important to
understand how this happens if we're

34
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:33,840
understand how this happens if we're
 

35
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,830
understand how this happens if we're
able to understand it and move past it.

36
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:35,840
able to understand it and move past it.
 

37
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,709
able to understand it and move past it.
At their core, tutorials offer problems

38
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:38,719
At their core, tutorials offer problems
 

39
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,430
At their core, tutorials offer problems
and solutions in a single piece of

40
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:41,440
and solutions in a single piece of
 

41
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,750
and solutions in a single piece of
content, which allows you to go from

42
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:43,760
content, which allows you to go from
 

43
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,670
content, which allows you to go from
being reliant on tutorials to be able to

44
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:45,680
being reliant on tutorials to be able to
 

45
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,310
being reliant on tutorials to be able to
make anything to being able to remember

46
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:48,320
make anything to being able to remember
 

47
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,310
make anything to being able to remember
all that stuff and make things that you

48
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:50,320
all that stuff and make things that you
 

49
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,069
all that stuff and make things that you
come up with yourself. Now, problems

50
00:00:52,069 --> 00:00:52,079
come up with yourself. Now, problems
 

51
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,229
come up with yourself. Now, problems
that tutorials solve or say, hey, this

52
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:54,239
that tutorials solve or say, hey, this
 

53
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,790
that tutorials solve or say, hey, this
is a design, an environment, whatever.

54
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:56,800
is a design, an environment, whatever.
 

55
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,910
is a design, an environment, whatever.
I'm going to show you how to make it.

56
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:57,920
I'm going to show you how to make it.
 

57
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,349
I'm going to show you how to make it.
You don't know how to make it. This

58
00:00:59,349 --> 00:00:59,359
You don't know how to make it. This
 

59
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,750
You don't know how to make it. This
video will show you that. Or say, hey, I

60
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:01,760
video will show you that. Or say, hey, I
 

61
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,950
video will show you that. Or say, hey, I
don't know how to make a cloth

62
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:02,960
don't know how to make a cloth
 

63
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,109
don't know how to make a cloth
simulation. That's the problem. the

64
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:05,119
simulation. That's the problem. the
 

65
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,109
simulation. That's the problem. the
video will solve it. Now, after a couple

66
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:07,119
video will solve it. Now, after a couple
 

67
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,350
video will solve it. Now, after a couple
years of doing this, those tutorials

68
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:09,360
years of doing this, those tutorials
 

69
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,590
years of doing this, those tutorials
just stop being useful. You stop really

70
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:11,600
just stop being useful. You stop really
 

71
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,030
just stop being useful. You stop really
needing the ones that keep getting

72
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:13,040
needing the ones that keep getting
 

73
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,390
needing the ones that keep getting
uploaded or the ones that have existed

74
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:14,400
uploaded or the ones that have existed
 

75
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,710
uploaded or the ones that have existed
for a long time. And that's exactly what

76
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:16,720
for a long time. And that's exactly what
 

77
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,390
for a long time. And that's exactly what
had been happening to me for quite a

78
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:18,400
had been happening to me for quite a
 

79
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,550
had been happening to me for quite a
while. And I felt stagnant. I felt like

80
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:20,560
while. And I felt stagnant. I felt like
 

81
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,310
while. And I felt stagnant. I felt like
I wasn't learning anything new yet. I

82
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:22,320
I wasn't learning anything new yet. I
 

83
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,070
I wasn't learning anything new yet. I
saw a lot of work that I didn't know how

84
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:24,080
saw a lot of work that I didn't know how
 

85
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,670
saw a lot of work that I didn't know how
to do. And I knew there was things to

86
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:25,680
to do. And I knew there was things to
 

87
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,710
to do. And I knew there was things to
learn, but I was too reliant on YouTube

88
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:28,720
learn, but I was too reliant on YouTube
 

89
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,830
learn, but I was too reliant on YouTube
tutorials and courses. So, how did I

90
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:31,840
tutorials and courses. So, how did I
 

91
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,630
tutorials and courses. So, how did I
move past this? I did thematic studies

92
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:34,640
move past this? I did thematic studies
 

93
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,109
move past this? I did thematic studies
of large groups of work with the goal of

94
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:37,119
of large groups of work with the goal of
 

95
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,270
of large groups of work with the goal of
studying them enough to find things that

96
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:39,280
studying them enough to find things that
 

97
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,670
studying them enough to find things that
I don't know how to do. First, I have to

98
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:41,680
I don't know how to do. First, I have to
 

99
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,749
I don't know how to do. First, I have to
pick a topic. I have to collect the

100
00:01:43,749 --> 00:01:43,759
pick a topic. I have to collect the
 

101
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,990
pick a topic. I have to collect the
inspiration on that topic. Then, I have

102
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,000
inspiration on that topic. Then, I have
 

103
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,670
inspiration on that topic. Then, I have
to start looking at those images and

104
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:47,680
to start looking at those images and
 

105
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,749
to start looking at those images and
videos and start getting challenged. The

106
00:01:49,749 --> 00:01:49,759
videos and start getting challenged. The
 

107
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,270
videos and start getting challenged. The
goal here is to make a lot of project

108
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:51,280
goal here is to make a lot of project
 

109
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,630
goal here is to make a lot of project
files. You don't have to finish them,

110
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:52,640
files. You don't have to finish them,
 

111
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,469
files. You don't have to finish them,
but find things that really challenge

112
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:54,479
but find things that really challenge
 

113
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,109
but find things that really challenge
you. Then after a lot of R&D, distill

114
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:57,119
you. Then after a lot of R&D, distill
 

115
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,990
you. Then after a lot of R&D, distill
all of this work into five really cool

116
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,000
all of this work into five really cool
 

117
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,830
all of this work into five really cool
images that feel like they fit within

118
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:01,840
images that feel like they fit within
 

119
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,149
images that feel like they fit within
the work that you collected for this

120
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:04,159
the work that you collected for this
 

121
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,389
the work that you collected for this
project. Now, I mentioned I did this all

122
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:06,399
project. Now, I mentioned I did this all
 

123
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,270
project. Now, I mentioned I did this all
of 2024. There were a ton of videos that

124
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:09,280
of 2024. There were a ton of videos that
 

125
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,949
of 2024. There were a ton of videos that
I uploaded that year that were

126
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:10,959
I uploaded that year that were
 

127
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,430
I uploaded that year that were
breakdowns of projects. Those projects

128
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:13,440
breakdowns of projects. Those projects
 

129
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,750
breakdowns of projects. Those projects
came from those self-appointed research

130
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:15,760
came from those self-appointed research
 

131
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,990
came from those self-appointed research
and development sprints that I did. I

132
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,000
and development sprints that I did. I
 

133
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,070
and development sprints that I did. I
would make those boards and really study

134
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,080
would make those boards and really study
 

135
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,150
would make those boards and really study
them and they would challenge me. I'm

136
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,160
them and they would challenge me. I'm
 

137
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,910
them and they would challenge me. I'm
going to use this video as an example to

138
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:23,920
going to use this video as an example to
 

139
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,150
going to use this video as an example to
show you how I did all that. This video

140
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,160
show you how I did all that. This video
 

141
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,229
show you how I did all that. This video
was called the power of curves and this

142
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:28,239
was called the power of curves and this
 

143
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,710
was called the power of curves and this
was a product of learning really cool

144
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:30,720
was a product of learning really cool
 

145
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,949
was a product of learning really cool
things. I wanted to see how far I can

146
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:32,959
things. I wanted to see how far I can
 

147
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,430
things. I wanted to see how far I can
take using geometry nodes with curves to

148
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:35,440
take using geometry nodes with curves to
 

149
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,430
take using geometry nodes with curves to
make really beautiful animations. So,

150
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:37,440
make really beautiful animations. So,
 

151
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,430
make really beautiful animations. So,
first I collected a Pinterest boards of

152
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:39,440
first I collected a Pinterest boards of
 

153
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,830
first I collected a Pinterest boards of
just images that I thought were cool.

154
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:41,840
just images that I thought were cool.
 

155
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,110
just images that I thought were cool.
Don't pick images that you think you

156
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:43,120
Don't pick images that you think you
 

157
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,710
Don't pick images that you think you
know how to do. Just pick images that

158
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:44,720
know how to do. Just pick images that
 

159
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,390
know how to do. Just pick images that
you think are cool cuz that will lead

160
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:46,400
you think are cool cuz that will lead
 

161
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,550
you think are cool cuz that will lead
you to roadblocks. Let's take this

162
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:48,560
you to roadblocks. Let's take this
 

163
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,270
you to roadblocks. Let's take this
animation for example. I wanted to make

164
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:51,280
animation for example. I wanted to make
 

165
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,630
animation for example. I wanted to make
something that kind of looked like an

166
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:52,640
something that kind of looked like an
 

167
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,630
something that kind of looked like an
eyeball of curves. So, the first thing I

168
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:54,640
eyeball of curves. So, the first thing I
 

169
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,470
eyeball of curves. So, the first thing I
didn't know how to do was how to array

170
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:56,480
didn't know how to do was how to array
 

171
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,990
didn't know how to do was how to array
all of those curves in a circular

172
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,000
all of those curves in a circular
 

173
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,070
all of those curves in a circular
pattern and have them point outward. So,

174
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,080
pattern and have them point outward. So,
 

175
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,830
pattern and have them point outward. So,
that was a rabbit hole that I had to go

176
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:01,840
that was a rabbit hole that I had to go
 

177
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,750
that was a rabbit hole that I had to go
down to to learn how to basically point

178
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:03,760
down to to learn how to basically point
 

179
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,350
down to to learn how to basically point
things out based on the normal. Then, I

180
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:05,360
things out based on the normal. Then, I
 

181
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,350
things out based on the normal. Then, I
had to figure out how to displace them

182
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:07,360
had to figure out how to displace them
 

183
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,790
had to figure out how to displace them
properly, how to get those curves to

184
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:08,800
properly, how to get those curves to
 

185
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,110
properly, how to get those curves to
actually move in a way that I wanted and

186
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:11,120
actually move in a way that I wanted and
 

187
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,949
actually move in a way that I wanted and
controlled. And I didn't understand how

188
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:12,959
controlled. And I didn't understand how
 

189
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,710
controlled. And I didn't understand how
to do that. That was more research that

190
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:14,720
to do that. That was more research that
 

191
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,550
to do that. That was more research that
I had to do. Then I had to learn how to

192
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:16,560
I had to do. Then I had to learn how to
 

193
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,949
I had to do. Then I had to learn how to
get light to properly move up and down

194
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:18,959
get light to properly move up and down
 

195
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,589
get light to properly move up and down
these curves and how to randomly place

196
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:21,599
these curves and how to randomly place
 

197
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,350
these curves and how to randomly place
those lights. So, not all the curves had

198
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:23,360
those lights. So, not all the curves had
 

199
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,270
those lights. So, not all the curves had
those moving lights on them. All of

200
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,280
those moving lights on them. All of
 

201
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,869
those moving lights on them. All of
those things were things I did not know

202
00:03:26,869 --> 00:03:26,879
those things were things I did not know
 

203
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,309
those things were things I did not know
how to do. I had to go through Blender

204
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:28,319
how to do. I had to go through Blender
 

205
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,030
how to do. I had to go through Blender
subreddits and forums and a lot of hair

206
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,040
subreddits and forums and a lot of hair
 

207
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,030
subreddits and forums and a lot of hair
pulling to figure these things out and

208
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,040
pulling to figure these things out and
 

209
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,869
pulling to figure these things out and
it resulted in one of my absolute

210
00:03:34,869 --> 00:03:34,879
it resulted in one of my absolute
 

211
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,710
it resulted in one of my absolute
favorite animations I've ever done.

212
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:36,720
favorite animations I've ever done.
 

213
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,390
favorite animations I've ever done.
Another really cool and kind of simple

214
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:38,400
Another really cool and kind of simple
 

215
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,710
Another really cool and kind of simple
problem solving was I found this image

216
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:40,720
problem solving was I found this image
 

217
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,630
problem solving was I found this image
and I wanted to make something similar

218
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:42,640
and I wanted to make something similar
 

219
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,630
and I wanted to make something similar
to it. So my first task was was to take

220
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:44,640
to it. So my first task was was to take
 

221
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,550
to it. So my first task was was to take
curves and have smaller and smaller

222
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:46,560
curves and have smaller and smaller
 

223
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,630
curves and have smaller and smaller
smaller ones moving inwards first to be

224
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:48,640
smaller ones moving inwards first to be
 

225
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,789
smaller ones moving inwards first to be
able to displace them. I did not know

226
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:50,799
able to displace them. I did not know
 

227
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,470
able to displace them. I did not know
how to do that in geometry nodes which

228
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:52,480
how to do that in geometry nodes which
 

229
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,710
how to do that in geometry nodes which
led me to figuring out how to use

230
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:54,720
led me to figuring out how to use
 

231
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,350
led me to figuring out how to use
simulation nodes in a very simple way to

232
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:57,360
simulation nodes in a very simple way to
 

233
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,910
simulation nodes in a very simple way to
get them to sort of array inward. And

234
00:03:59,910 --> 00:03:59,920
get them to sort of array inward. And
 

235
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,589
get them to sort of array inward. And
then all I had to do was displace them

236
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:01,599
then all I had to do was displace them
 

237
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,789
then all I had to do was displace them
and figure out some things that I

238
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:02,799
and figure out some things that I
 

239
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,190
and figure out some things that I
already knew how to do. But it it taught

240
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:05,200
already knew how to do. But it it taught
 

241
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,830
already knew how to do. But it it taught
me how to use a really simple tool which

242
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:07,840
me how to use a really simple tool which
 

243
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,270
me how to use a really simple tool which
is the simulation nodes very

244
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:09,280
is the simulation nodes very
 

245
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,190
is the simulation nodes very
primitively. Now this one I was really

246
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:11,200
primitively. Now this one I was really
 

247
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,869
primitively. Now this one I was really
inspired by. I wanted to figure out how

248
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:12,879
inspired by. I wanted to figure out how
 

249
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,509
inspired by. I wanted to figure out how
to take a big sort of array of curves

250
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:15,519
to take a big sort of array of curves
 

251
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,030
to take a big sort of array of curves
and just sort of like make them move

252
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:17,040
and just sort of like make them move
 

253
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,550
and just sort of like make them move
around uh kind of like something you

254
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:18,560
around uh kind of like something you
 

255
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,789
around uh kind of like something you
would see in the ocean. So, first

256
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:20,799
would see in the ocean. So, first
 

257
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:22,629
would see in the ocean. So, first
because I figured out how to use

258
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:22,639
because I figured out how to use
 

259
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,790
because I figured out how to use
simulation nodes to create an array, I

260
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:24,800
simulation nodes to create an array, I
 

261
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,749
simulation nodes to create an array, I
created an array of those curves, then I

262
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:27,759
created an array of those curves, then I
 

263
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,230
created an array of those curves, then I
was able to displace these guys. But the

264
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:30,240
was able to displace these guys. But the
 

265
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,629
was able to displace these guys. But the
problem was the bottoms of them were

266
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:32,639
problem was the bottoms of them were
 

267
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,230
problem was the bottoms of them were
moving with the displacement, which

268
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:34,240
moving with the displacement, which
 

269
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,710
moving with the displacement, which
meant I had to figure out how to isolate

270
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:36,720
meant I had to figure out how to isolate
 

271
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,350
meant I had to figure out how to isolate
the displacement only to the top

272
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:39,360
the displacement only to the top
 

273
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,590
the displacement only to the top
portion, which led me to figuring out

274
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:41,600
portion, which led me to figuring out
 

275
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,830
portion, which led me to figuring out
how to use position information to

276
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:43,840
how to use position information to
 

277
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,070
how to use position information to
isolate the bottom to keep it still and

278
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,080
isolate the bottom to keep it still and
 

279
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,469
isolate the bottom to keep it still and
have the top only move and have some

280
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:48,479
have the top only move and have some
 

281
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,550
have the top only move and have some
control. That took a little bit of R&D

282
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:50,560
control. That took a little bit of R&D
 

283
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,390
control. That took a little bit of R&D
on my end to understand vector math,

284
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:52,400
on my end to understand vector math,
 

285
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,150
on my end to understand vector math,
understand position, and how to mix

286
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:54,160
understand position, and how to mix
 

287
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,469
understand position, and how to mix
things together in order to get that to

288
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:56,479
things together in order to get that to
 

289
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,550
things together in order to get that to
look nice. Now, I did this multiple

290
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:58,560
look nice. Now, I did this multiple
 

291
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,390
look nice. Now, I did this multiple
times and I'm even working on the next

292
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:00,400
times and I'm even working on the next
 

293
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,230
times and I'm even working on the next
one, which is all about recreating

294
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:02,240
one, which is all about recreating
 

295
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,629
one, which is all about recreating
really cool sci-fi looking things. And

296
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:04,639
really cool sci-fi looking things. And
 

297
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,150
really cool sci-fi looking things. And
there will be a lot of things that I

298
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,160
there will be a lot of things that I
 

299
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,510
there will be a lot of things that I
learned from that that will turn into

300
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:07,520
learned from that that will turn into
 

301
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,270
learned from that that will turn into
tutorials that I put on this channel.

302
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:09,280
tutorials that I put on this channel.
 

303
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,830
tutorials that I put on this channel.
So, it not only benefits me personally,

304
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:11,840
So, it not only benefits me personally,
 

305
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,430
So, it not only benefits me personally,
it benefits the YouTube channel. It

306
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:13,440
it benefits the YouTube channel. It
 

307
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,950
it benefits the YouTube channel. It
benefits the Patreon because all of

308
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:14,960
benefits the Patreon because all of
 

309
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,390
benefits the Patreon because all of
these projects I ended up putting on

310
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:16,400
these projects I ended up putting on
 

311
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,390
these projects I ended up putting on
Patreon. And like I said, I'm distilling

312
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:18,400
Patreon. And like I said, I'm distilling
 

313
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,310
Patreon. And like I said, I'm distilling
I'm creating five or so images from each

314
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:20,320
I'm creating five or so images from each
 

315
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,150
I'm creating five or so images from each
one and those turn into tutorials for

316
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:22,160
one and those turn into tutorials for
 

317
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,990
one and those turn into tutorials for
everything that I'm doing. So, for me

318
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,000
everything that I'm doing. So, for me
 

319
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,909
everything that I'm doing. So, for me
personally, it's been a huge huge

320
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:25,919
personally, it's been a huge huge
 

321
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,830
personally, it's been a huge huge
benefit. and you as an artist doing

322
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:27,840
benefit. and you as an artist doing
 

323
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,670
benefit. and you as an artist doing
whatever you want to do with your art. I

324
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:29,680
whatever you want to do with your art. I
 

325
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,390
whatever you want to do with your art. I
also think it is going to be a huge huge

326
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:32,400
also think it is going to be a huge huge
 

327
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,870
also think it is going to be a huge huge
benefit to do these kind of sprints. So

328
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:34,880
benefit to do these kind of sprints. So
 

329
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,590
benefit to do these kind of sprints. So
to summarize this process, it goes to

330
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:37,600
to summarize this process, it goes to
 

331
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,909
to summarize this process, it goes to
picking a topic, collecting inspiration

332
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:39,919
picking a topic, collecting inspiration
 

333
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,390
picking a topic, collecting inspiration
on that topic. Get as much as you can,

334
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:42,400
on that topic. Get as much as you can,
 

335
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,230
on that topic. Get as much as you can,
then start diving into the things that

336
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:44,240
then start diving into the things that
 

337
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,670
then start diving into the things that
you think are interesting and start

338
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:45,680
you think are interesting and start
 

339
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,270
you think are interesting and start
getting challenged and make a lot of

340
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,280
getting challenged and make a lot of
 

341
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,629
getting challenged and make a lot of
different project files. Then once

342
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:48,639
different project files. Then once
 

343
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,230
different project files. Then once
you've gone through the ringer of

344
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:50,240
you've gone through the ringer of
 

345
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,469
you've gone through the ringer of
research and Reddits and YouTubes and

346
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:52,479
research and Reddits and YouTubes and
 

347
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,629
research and Reddits and YouTubes and
all of the hair pulling frustration of

348
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:54,639
all of the hair pulling frustration of
 

349
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,830
all of the hair pulling frustration of
learning things you don't know how to

350
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:55,840
learning things you don't know how to
 

351
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,390
learning things you don't know how to
do, distill those into five really cool

352
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:58,400
do, distill those into five really cool
 

353
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,150
do, distill those into five really cool
designs that you can be proud of and put

354
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:00,160

00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:04,000
own work, doing whatever you want. I
 

359
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,909
own work, doing whatever you want. I
would recommend doing that once a month.

360
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:05,919
would recommend doing that once a month.
 

361
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,749
