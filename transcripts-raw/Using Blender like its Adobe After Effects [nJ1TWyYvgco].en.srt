00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:02,080
How's it going? So, you may have seen
 

3
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,070
How's it going? So, you may have seen
this effect uh somewhere on the

4
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:04,080
this effect uh somewhere on the
 

5
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,430
this effect uh somewhere on the
internet. And if you don't know what

6
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:05,440
internet. And if you don't know what
 

7
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,430
internet. And if you don't know what
it's called, it's called blob tracking.

8
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:07,440
it's called, it's called blob tracking.
 

9
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,509
it's called, it's called blob tracking.
And typically, it's made in touch

10
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:09,519
And typically, it's made in touch
 

11
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:10,629
And typically, it's made in touch
designer. But if you don't know how to

12
00:00:10,629 --> 00:00:10,639
designer. But if you don't know how to
 

13
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,070
designer. But if you don't know how to
use touch designer or don't want to pay

14
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:12,080
use touch designer or don't want to pay
 

15
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,589
use touch designer or don't want to pay
for it, I'm going to show you how to get

16
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:13,599
for it, I'm going to show you how to get
 

17
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,829
for it, I'm going to show you how to get
this effect completely free in Blender.

18
00:00:15,829 --> 00:00:15,839
this effect completely free in Blender.
 

19
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,349
this effect completely free in Blender.
There's four main steps to be able to

20
00:00:17,349 --> 00:00:17,359
There's four main steps to be able to
 

21
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,790
There's four main steps to be able to
achieve this look. First thing we're

22
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:18,800
achieve this look. First thing we're
 

23
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,390
achieve this look. First thing we're
going to do is create some geometry

24
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:20,400
going to do is create some geometry
 

25
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,230
going to do is create some geometry
that's going to have variation in

26
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:22,240
that's going to have variation in
 

27
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,230
that's going to have variation in
geometry size, which is going to

28
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:24,240
geometry size, which is going to
 

29
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,390
geometry size, which is going to
correlate to the effect in the shading.

30
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:26,400
correlate to the effect in the shading.
 

31
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,390
correlate to the effect in the shading.
Next, we're going to use an attribute to

32
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:28,400
Next, we're going to use an attribute to
 

33
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,390
Next, we're going to use an attribute to
turn the geometry into a texture that we

34
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:30,400
turn the geometry into a texture that we
 

35
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,630
turn the geometry into a texture that we
can use in the shader editor and use

36
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:32,640
can use in the shader editor and use
 

37
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,630
can use in the shader editor and use
that to kind of displace and glitch

38
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:34,640
that to kind of displace and glitch
 

39
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,549
that to kind of displace and glitch
around the image that we're using.

40
00:00:36,549 --> 00:00:36,559
around the image that we're using.
 

41
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,069
around the image that we're using.
Because this effect is created with

42
00:00:38,069 --> 00:00:38,079
Because this effect is created with
 

43
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,470
Because this effect is created with
geometry, we can actually take geometry,

44
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:40,480
geometry, we can actually take geometry,
 

45
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,470
geometry, we can actually take geometry,
convert it, and have them all connect

46
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:42,480
convert it, and have them all connect
 

47
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,709
convert it, and have them all connect
with curves. Then all we have to do is

48
00:00:44,709 --> 00:00:44,719
with curves. Then all we have to do is
 

49
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,389
with curves. Then all we have to do is
take the one noise texture that is

50
00:00:46,389 --> 00:00:46,399
take the one noise texture that is
 

51
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,549
take the one noise texture that is
creating all of these movements, animate

52
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:48,559
creating all of these movements, animate
 

53
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,790
creating all of these movements, animate
it, and you're completely done. So, it

54
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:50,800
it, and you're completely done. So, it
 

55
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,709
it, and you're completely done. So, it
is just as simple as that. If you don't

56
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:52,719
is just as simple as that. If you don't
 

57
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,990

get into this tutorial. All right, so
 

83
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,070
get into this tutorial. All right, so
let's start with step number one. and

84
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:18,080
let's start with step number one. and
 

85
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,749
let's start with step number one. and
we're going to go ahead and hit shift A

86
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:19,759
we're going to go ahead and hit shift A
 

87
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,910
we're going to go ahead and hit shift A
and throw a plane or any piece of

88
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:21,920
and throw a plane or any piece of
 

89
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,310
and throw a plane or any piece of
geometry into the main workspace. I'm

90
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:24,320
geometry into the main workspace. I'm
 

91
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,109
geometry into the main workspace. I'm
going to be using Blender

92
00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:26,119
going to be using Blender
 

93
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:28,630
going to be using Blender
4.4.1. We're just going to open up a new

94
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:28,640
4.4.1. We're just going to open up a new
 

95
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,710
4.4.1. We're just going to open up a new
window. Switch this one over to the

96
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:30,720
window. Switch this one over to the
 

97
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,149
window. Switch this one over to the
geometry nodes editor. I'm going to hit

98
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:32,159
geometry nodes editor. I'm going to hit
 

99
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,510
geometry nodes editor. I'm going to hit
in and then we're going to get a new

100
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:33,520
in and then we're going to get a new
 

101
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,190
in and then we're going to get a new
geometry nodes tree. Let's go ahead and

102
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:35,200
geometry nodes tree. Let's go ahead and
 

103
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,789
geometry nodes tree. Let's go ahead and
delete the group input. And we're going

104
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:36,799
delete the group input. And we're going
 

105
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,590
delete the group input. And we're going
to go ahead and get in

106
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:38,600
to go ahead and get in
 

107
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,230
to go ahead and get in
a

108
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:41,240
a
 

109
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,350
a
grid. Also, I'm going to hit the tilt

110
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:43,360
grid. Also, I'm going to hit the tilt
 

111
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,270
grid. Also, I'm going to hit the tilt
key over here, go to the top, and we're

112
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:45,280
key over here, go to the top, and we're
 

113
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,510
key over here, go to the top, and we're
going to go and get our camera. And then

114
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:47,520
going to go and get our camera. And then
 

115
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,190
going to go and get our camera. And then
I'm just going to bring it out. I'm

116
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:49,200
I'm just going to bring it out. I'm
 

117
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,950
I'm just going to bring it out. I'm
really doing this just visually to fit

118
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:50,960
really doing this just visually to fit
 

119
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,550
really doing this just visually to fit
the geometry to a 16x9 space, which is

120
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:54,560
the geometry to a 16x9 space, which is
 

121
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,630
the geometry to a 16x9 space, which is
what it's created by default. So I'm

122
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:56,640
what it's created by default. So I'm
 

123
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,230
what it's created by default. So I'm
going to go ahead with the grid and just

124
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:58,240
going to go ahead with the grid and just
 

125
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,069
going to go ahead with the grid and just
kind of eyeball it. This does not need

126
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:00,079
kind of eyeball it. This does not need
 

127
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,910
kind of eyeball it. This does not need
to be exact. This is just sort of an

128
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:01,920
to be exact. This is just sort of an
 

129
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,630
to be exact. This is just sort of an
artistic approach to this. So exact

130
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:04,640
artistic approach to this. So exact
 

131
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,709
artistic approach to this. So exact
measurements really are not necessary.

132
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:06,719
measurements really are not necessary.
 

133
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,590
measurements really are not necessary.
I'm going to go over here to the

134
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:07,600
I'm going to go over here to the
 

135
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,190
I'm going to go over here to the
wireframe view. And right now we just

136
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:09,200
wireframe view. And right now we just
 

137
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,270
wireframe view. And right now we just
have four faces. Right now we just have

138
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:11,280
have four faces. Right now we just have
 

139
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,710
have four faces. Right now we just have
four faces here. So what I'm going to do

140
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:12,720
four faces here. So what I'm going to do
 

141
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,470
four faces here. So what I'm going to do
is just get them to be get them to be

142
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:14,480
is just get them to be get them to be
 

143
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,390
is just get them to be get them to be
relatively square. So, we're going to do

144
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:17,400
relatively square. So, we're going to do
 

145
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,150
relatively square. So, we're going to do
six by four. And this is the first set.

146
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:20,160
six by four. And this is the first set.
 

147
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,150
six by four. And this is the first set.
And just imagine that when the image is

148
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,160
And just imagine that when the image is
 

149
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,390
And just imagine that when the image is
going to be spread across, these squares

150
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:24,400
going to be spread across, these squares
 

151
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,470
going to be spread across, these squares
are going to be where those glitchy

152
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:26,480
are going to be where those glitchy
 

153
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,350
are going to be where those glitchy
points go. So, depending on how small or

154
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:29,360
points go. So, depending on how small or
 

155
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,589
points go. So, depending on how small or
large you want those images to be,

156
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:31,599
large you want those images to be,
 

157
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,190
large you want those images to be,
that's going to correspond with the size

158
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:33,200
that's going to correspond with the size
 

159
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,710
that's going to correspond with the size
of your faces. Now, what we're going to

160
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:34,720
of your faces. Now, what we're going to
 

161
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,710
of your faces. Now, what we're going to
do is get a separate geometry node and

162
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:38,720
do is get a separate geometry node and
 

163
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,070
do is get a separate geometry node and
switch this over to separate faces.

164
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,080
switch this over to separate faces.
 

165
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,110
switch this over to separate faces.
We're going to get a join geometry node

166
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:45,120
We're going to get a join geometry node
 

167
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,710
We're going to get a join geometry node
and then plug in the invert. And what

168
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:46,720
and then plug in the invert. And what
 

169
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,309
and then plug in the invert. And what
we're going to do is plug a texture into

170
00:02:48,309 --> 00:02:48,319
we're going to do is plug a texture into
 

171
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,710
we're going to do is plug a texture into
this to tell it where and how much to

172
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:50,720
this to tell it where and how much to
 

173
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,150
this to tell it where and how much to
separate this geometry. If that doesn't

174
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:52,160
separate this geometry. If that doesn't
 

175
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,309
separate this geometry. If that doesn't
make any sense, um, just follow along

176
00:02:54,309 --> 00:02:54,319
make any sense, um, just follow along
 

177
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,990
make any sense, um, just follow along
and it will make sense. So, we're going

178
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,000
and it will make sense. So, we're going
 

179
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,030
and it will make sense. So, we're going
to go ahead and get in a noise texture.

180
00:02:59,030 --> 00:02:59,040
to go ahead and get in a noise texture.
 

181
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,710
to go ahead and get in a noise texture.
We're going to plug the factor into the

182
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:00,720
We're going to plug the factor into the
 

183
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,149
We're going to plug the factor into the
selection and nothing's going to happen

184
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:02,159
selection and nothing's going to happen
 

185
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,149
selection and nothing's going to happen
just mainly because the noise texture is

186
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:04,159
just mainly because the noise texture is
 

187
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,550
just mainly because the noise texture is
not dramatic enough. So, we're going to

188
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:06,560
not dramatic enough. So, we're going to
 

189
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,110
not dramatic enough. So, we're going to
get in a color ramp to force that. If we

190
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:09,120
get in a color ramp to force that. If we
 

191
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,710
get in a color ramp to force that. If we
switch this over to linear to constant

192
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:10,720
switch this over to linear to constant
 

193
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,309
switch this over to linear to constant
and then just bring the white one in the

194
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:12,319
and then just bring the white one in the
 

195
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,309
and then just bring the white one in the
middle and you can do 0.5 to make it

196
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:14,319
middle and you can do 0.5 to make it
 

197
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,990
middle and you can do 0.5 to make it
perfectly in the middle. Now this is set

198
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,000
perfectly in the middle. Now this is set
 

199
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,550
perfectly in the middle. Now this is set
up. You'll notice if we just get a

200
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:18,560
up. You'll notice if we just get a
 

201
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,630
up. You'll notice if we just get a
subdivide mesh node and throw it right

202
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:20,640
subdivide mesh node and throw it right
 

203
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,430
subdivide mesh node and throw it right
here. It's now going to take some of the

204
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:23,440
here. It's now going to take some of the
 

205
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,270
here. It's now going to take some of the
separated geometry and subdivide it. So

206
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,280
separated geometry and subdivide it. So
 

207
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,190
separated geometry and subdivide it. So
if you bring this over here, you can get

208
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:27,200
if you bring this over here, you can get
 

209
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,710
if you bring this over here, you can get
more or less subdivision in the

210
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:29,720
more or less subdivision in the
 

211
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,309
more or less subdivision in the
geometry. So now I'm going to take the

212
00:03:32,309 --> 00:03:32,319
geometry. So now I'm going to take the
 

213
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,990
geometry. So now I'm going to take the
portion of the geometry that is

214
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:34,000
portion of the geometry that is
 

215
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,710
portion of the geometry that is
subdivided. This line right here. We're

216
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:36,720
subdivided. This line right here. We're
 

217
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,390
subdivided. This line right here. We're
going to do another separate geometry.

218
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:38,400
going to do another separate geometry.
 

219
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,430
going to do another separate geometry.
So really, we're only going to be

220
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:39,440
So really, we're only going to be
 

221
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,430
So really, we're only going to be
dealing with the geometry that makes up

222
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:41,440
dealing with the geometry that makes up
 

223
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,190
dealing with the geometry that makes up
the portions that are subdivided. And

224
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,200
the portions that are subdivided. And
 

225
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,710
the portions that are subdivided. And
we're just going to plug it right there.

226
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:44,720
we're just going to plug it right there.
 

227
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,670
we're just going to plug it right there.
And then we're going to do the same

228
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:45,680
And then we're going to do the same
 

229
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,589
And then we're going to do the same
thing. Plug the noise texture, the color

230
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:47,599
thing. Plug the noise texture, the color
 

231
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,030
thing. Plug the noise texture, the color
ramp, just plug those right into the

232
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,040
ramp, just plug those right into the
 

233
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,430
ramp, just plug those right into the
selection. Plug the inverted into join

234
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:51,440
selection. Plug the inverted into join
 

235
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,630
selection. Plug the inverted into join
geometry. And then plug a subdivision or

236
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:54,640
geometry. And then plug a subdivision or
 

237
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,030
geometry. And then plug a subdivision or
subdivide mesh node there. And now we're

238
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,040
subdivide mesh node there. And now we're
 

239
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,789
subdivide mesh node there. And now we're
going to

240
00:03:57,789 --> 00:03:57,799
going to
 

241
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:00,630
going to
have this interesting set. So if you

242
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:00,640
have this interesting set. So if you
 

243
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,470
have this interesting set. So if you
switch this noise texture to 4D, you can

244
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:02,480
switch this noise texture to 4D, you can
 

245
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,030
switch this noise texture to 4D, you can
actually animate how this looks. I'm

246
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,040
actually animate how this looks. I'm
 

247
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,789
actually animate how this looks. I'm
going to bring the detail to zero just

248
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:06,799
going to bring the detail to zero just
 

249
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,750
going to bring the detail to zero just
so it's a cleaner look. And now you can

250
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:08,760
so it's a cleaner look. And now you can
 

251
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,350
so it's a cleaner look. And now you can
animate this subdivision look. I forget

252
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:11,360
animate this subdivision look. I forget
 

253
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,670
animate this subdivision look. I forget
the specific way to describe this style,

254
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:13,680
the specific way to describe this style,
 

255
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,949
the specific way to describe this style,
but that's how you achieve it. You

256
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:14,959
but that's how you achieve it. You
 

257
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,030
but that's how you achieve it. You
essentially do two sets of separation or

258
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:17,040
essentially do two sets of separation or
 

259
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,749
essentially do two sets of separation or
as many sets of separation as you want

260
00:04:19,749 --> 00:04:19,759
as many sets of separation as you want
 

261
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,069
as many sets of separation as you want
to get a really really interesting set.

262
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:22,079
to get a really really interesting set.
 

263
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,830
to get a really really interesting set.
Now that we have this, the point of

264
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:23,840
Now that we have this, the point of
 

265
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,230
Now that we have this, the point of
creating this in geometry is to be able

266
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:26,240
creating this in geometry is to be able
 

267
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,870
creating this in geometry is to be able
to convert it into a texture, but to be

268
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:28,880
to convert it into a texture, but to be
 

269
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,629
to convert it into a texture, but to be
able to go back and actually use the

270
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:30,639
able to go back and actually use the
 

271
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,710
able to go back and actually use the
geometry that we are turning into a

272
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:32,720
geometry that we are turning into a
 

273
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,350
geometry that we are turning into a
texture. So it all is created from the

274
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:35,360
texture. So it all is created from the
 

275
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,909
texture. So it all is created from the
same set of data. So what we can do now

276
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:37,919
same set of data. So what we can do now
 

277
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,670
same set of data. So what we can do now
is get a store named attribute node. I'm

278
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:41,680
is get a store named attribute node. I'm
 

279
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,950
is get a store named attribute node. I'm
just going to give it any name I want.

280
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:42,960
just going to give it any name I want.
 

281
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,710
just going to give it any name I want.
I'm going to do R just to represent that

282
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:44,720
I'm going to do R just to represent that
 

283
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,469
I'm going to do R just to represent that
it's random. And then we're going to

284
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:46,479
it's random. And then we're going to
 

285
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,310
it's random. And then we're going to
plug the color ramp. We're going to plug

286
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:48,320
plug the color ramp. We're going to plug
 

287
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,390
plug the color ramp. We're going to plug
the noise texture straight into the

288
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:50,400
the noise texture straight into the
 

289
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,830
the noise texture straight into the
value socket. And then we're going to

290
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:51,840
value socket. And then we're going to
 

291
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,909
value socket. And then we're going to
tell it make we're going to tell it to

292
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:53,919
tell it make we're going to tell it to
 

293
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,870
tell it make we're going to tell it to
recognize the faces. So now we're able

294
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:56,880
recognize the faces. So now we're able
 

295
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,629
recognize the faces. So now we're able
to throw this information into the

296
00:04:58,629 --> 00:04:58,639
to throw this information into the
 

297
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,790
to throw this information into the
shading and look at it like a texture.

298
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:00,800
shading and look at it like a texture.
 

299
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,590
shading and look at it like a texture.
So, what we'll do is get a set material

300
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:03,600
So, what we'll do is get a set material
 

301
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,070
So, what we'll do is get a set material
node. Go right over here and just create

302
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:06,080
node. Go right over here and just create
 

303
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,230
node. Go right over here and just create
a material and grab it right there. And

304
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:10,240
a material and grab it right there. And
 

305
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,150
a material and grab it right there. And
I'm going to switch over to the shading

306
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:12,160
I'm going to switch over to the shading
 

307
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,230
I'm going to switch over to the shading
tab. So, I'm just going to go ahead and

308
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,240
tab. So, I'm just going to go ahead and
 

309
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,310
tab. So, I'm just going to go ahead and
rearrange these windows really quickly.

310
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:16,320
rearrange these windows really quickly.
 

311
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,150
rearrange these windows really quickly.
I should just save these, but I just I

312
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,160
I should just save these, but I just I
 

313
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,390
I should just save these, but I just I
just never get around to it. Um, and

314
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:20,400
just never get around to it. Um, and
 

315
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,550
just never get around to it. Um, and
we're going to go here to the shader

316
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:21,560
we're going to go here to the shader
 

317
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,230
we're going to go here to the shader
editor. Now, what we want to do is go

318
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:24,240
editor. Now, what we want to do is go
 

319
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,909
editor. Now, what we want to do is go
ahead and call that attribute that we

320
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:25,919
ahead and call that attribute that we
 

321
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,270
ahead and call that attribute that we
created with the store named attribute

322
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:27,280
created with the store named attribute
 

323
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,870
created with the store named attribute
node. That's going to just be an

324
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:28,880
node. That's going to just be an
 

325
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,430
node. That's going to just be an
attribute node.

326
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:31,440
attribute node.
 

327
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,270
attribute node.
uh call the name which was R and plug

328
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:33,280
uh call the name which was R and plug
 

329
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,110
uh call the name which was R and plug
factor into base color. And now we can

330
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,120
factor into base color. And now we can
 

331
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,710
factor into base color. And now we can
see that texture. So if I were to go

332
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:36,720
see that texture. So if I were to go
 

333
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,790
see that texture. So if I were to go
back to geometry nodes and go to the

334
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:38,800
back to geometry nodes and go to the
 

335
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,430
back to geometry nodes and go to the
material preview window, I can play with

336
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:41,440
material preview window, I can play with
 

337
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,110
material preview window, I can play with
the W. And you'll notice we have

338
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:45,120
the W. And you'll notice we have
 

339
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,550
the W. And you'll notice we have
essentially a black and white texture

340
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,560
essentially a black and white texture
 

341
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,629
essentially a black and white texture
that we can uh play around with. So I'm

342
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:48,639
that we can uh play around with. So I'm
 

343
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,909
that we can uh play around with. So I'm
going to go back to the shading and

344
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:49,919
going to go back to the shading and
 

345
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,710
going to go back to the shading and
let's go ahead and put our image into

346
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:52,720
let's go ahead and put our image into
 

347
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,950
let's go ahead and put our image into
this scene. So go ahead and pick any

348
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:54,960
this scene. So go ahead and pick any
 

349
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,830
this scene. So go ahead and pick any
image or video that you want. either

350
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:57,840
image or video that you want. either
 

351
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,430
image or video that you want. either
images and videos, it will behave the

352
00:05:59,430 --> 00:05:59,440
images and videos, it will behave the
 

353
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,950
images and videos, it will behave the
same in terms of this glitching effect.

354
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:00,960
same in terms of this glitching effect.
 

355
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,990
same in terms of this glitching effect.
So, what I'm going to do is if you have

356
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:02,000
So, what I'm going to do is if you have
 

357
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,430
So, what I'm going to do is if you have
the node wrangler add-on enabled, just

358
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:03,440
the node wrangler add-on enabled, just
 

359
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,550
the node wrangler add-on enabled, just
hit control T. It's going to give you a

360
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:06,560
hit control T. It's going to give you a
 

361
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,950
hit control T. It's going to give you a
quick mapping setup. Use the object

362
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:08,960
quick mapping setup. Use the object
 

363
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,710
quick mapping setup. Use the object
coordinate and I'm going to click open

364
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:10,720
coordinate and I'm going to click open
 

365
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,870
coordinate and I'm going to click open
and grab my image. You can see a couple

366
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:12,880
and grab my image. You can see a couple
 

367
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,309
and grab my image. You can see a couple
of these images that I was playing with.

368
00:06:14,309 --> 00:06:14,319
of these images that I was playing with.
 

369
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,230
of these images that I was playing with.
I found these landscape images to look

370
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:16,240
I found these landscape images to look
 

371
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,990
I found these landscape images to look
really nice. And then I'm going to go

372
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,000
really nice. And then I'm going to go
 

373
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,110
really nice. And then I'm going to go
get an empty and use that as uh the

374
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,120
get an empty and use that as uh the
 

375
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,790
get an empty and use that as uh the
object that creates kind of my texture

376
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:22,800
object that creates kind of my texture
 

377
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,790
object that creates kind of my texture
coordinate or my mapping. So, if you

378
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:24,800
coordinate or my mapping. So, if you
 

379
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,350
coordinate or my mapping. So, if you
click the empty, then you can click the

380
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:27,360
click the empty, then you can click the
 

381
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,029
click the empty, then you can click the
empty here in the viewport and scale it

382
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:29,039
empty here in the viewport and scale it
 

383
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,550
empty here in the viewport and scale it
up. Now, the image is uh squished. It's

384
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:32,560
up. Now, the image is uh squished. It's
 

385
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,469
up. Now, the image is uh squished. It's
kind of a square. So, you can take your

386
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:34,479
kind of a square. So, you can take your
 

387
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,309
kind of a square. So, you can take your
empty and just sort of stretch it out.

388
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:36,319
empty and just sort of stretch it out.
 

389
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,350
empty and just sort of stretch it out.
Kind of eyeball it. Um I should just

390
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:39,360
Kind of eyeball it. Um I should just
 

391
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,790
Kind of eyeball it. Um I should just
look at the original image, but I'm just

392
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:40,800
look at the original image, but I'm just
 

393
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,870
look at the original image, but I'm just
going to go by memory of how I remember

394
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:42,880
going to go by memory of how I remember
 

395
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,590
going to go by memory of how I remember
it looking. And then one quick thing, go

396
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:45,600
it looking. And then one quick thing, go
 

397
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,189
it looking. And then one quick thing, go
ahead and just delete the principled and

398
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:47,199
ahead and just delete the principled and
 

399
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,189
ahead and just delete the principled and
plug the image straight into the

400
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:49,199
plug the image straight into the
 

401
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,029
plug the image straight into the
surface. And that's going to bring it

402
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:51,039
surface. And that's going to bring it
 

403
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,590
surface. And that's going to bring it
back to sort of the images original

404
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:53,600
back to sort of the images original
 

405
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,469
back to sort of the images original
color and contrast and all that. So it's

406
00:06:56,469 --> 00:06:56,479
color and contrast and all that. So it's
 

407
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,309
color and contrast and all that. So it's
not a surface. So you can just go ahead

408
00:06:59,309 --> 00:06:59,319
not a surface. So you can just go ahead
 

409
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:02,710
not a surface. So you can just go ahead
and scale up the image to fit whatever

410
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:02,720
and scale up the image to fit whatever
 

411
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,189
and scale up the image to fit whatever
square. I'm using a 16x9

412
00:07:06,189 --> 00:07:06,199
square. I'm using a 16x9
 

413
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:09,230
square. I'm using a 16x9
um ratio here. And this is now our

414
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:09,240
um ratio here. And this is now our
 

415
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,909
um ratio here. And this is now our
image. Now what we can do is right here

416
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:11,919
image. Now what we can do is right here
 

417
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,230
image. Now what we can do is right here
on this line get a mix

418
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:15,240
on this line get a mix
 

419
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,150
on this line get a mix
color. And now throw that texture or

420
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:18,160
color. And now throw that texture or
 

421
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,670
color. And now throw that texture or
that geometry straight into there. And

422
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:19,680
that geometry straight into there. And
 

423
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,950
that geometry straight into there. And
you're going to notice that glitch start

424
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:20,960
you're going to notice that glitch start
 

425
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,629
you're going to notice that glitch start
to happen. So it's starting to move it

426
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:22,639
to happen. So it's starting to move it
 

427
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,550
to happen. So it's starting to move it
around. It's combining your regular

428
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:24,560
around. It's combining your regular
 

429
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,350
around. It's combining your regular
mapping with this new black and white

430
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:27,360
mapping with this new black and white
 

431
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,870
mapping with this new black and white
value mapping. And it's going to kind of

432
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:28,880
value mapping. And it's going to kind of
 

433
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,710
value mapping. And it's going to kind of
play with it a little bit. And so we can

434
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:30,720
play with it a little bit. And so we can
 

435
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,790
play with it a little bit. And so we can
head back to geometry nodes. I'm going

436
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:32,800
head back to geometry nodes. I'm going
 

437
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,270
head back to geometry nodes. I'm going
collapse this window here. Notice there

438
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:35,280
collapse this window here. Notice there
 

439
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,870
collapse this window here. Notice there
is a line going straight into the store

440
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:38,880
is a line going straight into the store
 

441
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,550
is a line going straight into the store
named attribute. So what we can do is

442
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:40,560
named attribute. So what we can do is
 

443
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,270
named attribute. So what we can do is
get a color ramp to play with that a

444
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:43,280
get a color ramp to play with that a
 

445
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,350
get a color ramp to play with that a
little bit. So, if you get a color ramp,

446
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:45,360
little bit. So, if you get a color ramp,
 

447
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,309
little bit. So, if you get a color ramp,
switch it to

448
00:07:47,309 --> 00:07:47,319
switch it to
 

449
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:50,670
switch it to
constant, you'll be able to just get a

450
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:50,680
constant, you'll be able to just get a
 

451
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,309
constant, you'll be able to just get a
couple, say something like like this.

452
00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:54,319
couple, say something like like this.
 

453
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,790
couple, say something like like this.
And then I'm going to go back to the

454
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:55,800
And then I'm going to go back to the
 

455
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,430
And then I'm going to go back to the
empty and get that background image to

456
00:07:59,430 --> 00:07:59,440
empty and get that background image to
 

457
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,909
empty and get that background image to
be scaled properly. There we go. And

458
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:01,919
be scaled properly. There we go. And
 

459
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,909
be scaled properly. There we go. And
then if you play with the W, we now have

460
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:03,919
then if you play with the W, we now have
 

461
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,390
then if you play with the W, we now have
this

462
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:05,400
this
 

463
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,230
this
image glitching around. And it's pretty

464
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:08,240
image glitching around. And it's pretty
 

465
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,430
image glitching around. And it's pretty
cool. What I found looks really good is

466
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:11,440
cool. What I found looks really good is
 

467
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,150
cool. What I found looks really good is
if you get a wave texture with a scale

468
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:14,160
if you get a wave texture with a scale
 

469
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,950
if you get a wave texture with a scale
of

470
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:15,960
of
 

471
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,790
of
0.5,

472
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:17,800
0.5,
 

473
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,869
0.5,
it makes the images feel a little bit

474
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:20,879
it makes the images feel a little bit
 

475
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,390
it makes the images feel a little bit
better. We're going to do a scale of two

476
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:22,400
better. We're going to do a scale of two
 

477
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,950
better. We're going to do a scale of two
on the noise texture. And it does I do

478
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:24,960
on the noise texture. And it does I do
 

479
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,510
on the noise texture. And it does I do
appreciate the behavior a little bit

480
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:27,520
appreciate the behavior a little bit
 

481
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,710
appreciate the behavior a little bit
more. So, I'm going to flip my color

482
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:28,720
more. So, I'm going to flip my color
 

483
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,870
more. So, I'm going to flip my color
ramp

484
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:31,880

 

485
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,230

actually. And I noticed when I flipped

486
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:34,240
actually. And I noticed when I flipped
 

487
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,589
actually. And I noticed when I flipped
the color ramp, he used the combination

488
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:35,599
the color ramp, he used the combination
 

489
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,070
the color ramp, he used the combination
with the wave. I really do enjoy that

490
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:38,080
with the wave. I really do enjoy that
 

491
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,790
with the wave. I really do enjoy that
movement quite a bit more than the

492
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:39,800
movement quite a bit more than the
 

493
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,389
movement quite a bit more than the
original. Um, but really it's going to

494
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:42,399
original. Um, but really it's going to
 

495
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,509
original. Um, but really it's going to
be up to just playing with it. You can

496
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:43,519
be up to just playing with it. You can
 

497
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,949
be up to just playing with it. You can
just keep the noise texture, play with

498
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:44,959
just keep the noise texture, play with
 

499
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,870
just keep the noise texture, play with
those values. Um, but this I really,

500
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:48,880
those values. Um, but this I really,
 

501
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,870
those values. Um, but this I really,
really like. So, now that we have

502
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:51,880
really like. So, now that we have
 

503
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,630
really like. So, now that we have
this working properly, we now need to

504
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:54,640
this working properly, we now need to
 

505
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,790
this working properly, we now need to
create that effect where all of those

506
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:56,800
create that effect where all of those
 

507
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,590
create that effect where all of those
little squares have this red line

508
00:08:59,590 --> 00:08:59,600
little squares have this red line
 

509
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,949
little squares have this red line
connecting to each other.

510
00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:02,959
connecting to each other.
 

511
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,230
connecting to each other.
So, we're going to go back to the

512
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:04,240
So, we're going to go back to the
 

513
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,790
So, we're going to go back to the
wireframe view. And what I'm going to do

514
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:06,800
wireframe view. And what I'm going to do
 

515
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,030
wireframe view. And what I'm going to do
is I'm just going to go ahead and sever

516
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,040
is I'm just going to go ahead and sever
 

517
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,670
is I'm just going to go ahead and sever
the connection right there. And we're

518
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:11,680
the connection right there. And we're
 

519
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,190
the connection right there. And we're
going to go ahead and get

520
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:14,200
going to go ahead and get
 

521
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,110
going to go ahead and get
a delete geometry. And I'm going to plug

522
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,120
a delete geometry. And I'm going to plug
 

523
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,350
a delete geometry. And I'm going to plug
the the color amp right here that plugs

524
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:19,360
the the color amp right here that plugs
 

525
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,949
the the color amp right here that plugs
into the store named attribute. This

526
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:20,959
into the store named attribute. This
 

527
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,710
into the store named attribute. This
color amp is the one that crunches in

528
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:22,720
color amp is the one that crunches in
 

529
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,389
color amp is the one that crunches in
those images to just a couple of those

530
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:24,399
those images to just a couple of those
 

531
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,550
those images to just a couple of those
cubes, a couple of those squares that

532
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:26,560
cubes, a couple of those squares that
 

533
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,790
cubes, a couple of those squares that
glitch in and out. So I want to use that

534
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:28,800
glitch in and out. So I want to use that
 

535
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,190
glitch in and out. So I want to use that
same specification to be plugged into

536
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:31,200
same specification to be plugged into
 

537
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,230
same specification to be plugged into
the delete geometry. So we can actually

538
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:33,240
the delete geometry. So we can actually
 

539
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,630
the delete geometry. So we can actually
delete that specific geometry. So what

540
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:36,640
delete that specific geometry. So what
 

541
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,470
delete that specific geometry. So what
I'm going to do is plug this join

542
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:38,480
I'm going to do is plug this join
 

543
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,670
I'm going to do is plug this join
geometry, the one that goes right before

544
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:39,680
geometry, the one that goes right before
 

545
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,750
geometry, the one that goes right before
the store named attribute right after

546
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:41,760
the store named attribute right after
 

547
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,430
the store named attribute right after
all of these nodes that created that

548
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:43,440
all of these nodes that created that
 

549
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,949
all of these nodes that created that
variation geometry. Plug that into the

550
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:46,959
variation geometry. Plug that into the
 

551
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,509
variation geometry. Plug that into the
geometry. Switch this over to face.

552
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:49,519
geometry. Switch this over to face.
 

553
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,710
geometry. Switch this over to face.
We're going to plug the color ramp into

554
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:51,720
We're going to plug the color ramp into
 

555
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,230
We're going to plug the color ramp into
that and then plug and then we're going

556
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:54,240
that and then plug and then we're going
 

557
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:54,910
that and then plug and then we're going
to get

558
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:54,920
to get
 

559
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,750
to get
a join geometry so that we can plug this

560
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:57,760
a join geometry so that we can plug this
 

561
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,350
a join geometry so that we can plug this
stuff that all this this image

562
00:09:59,350 --> 00:09:59,360
stuff that all this this image
 

563
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,790
stuff that all this this image
information into it and this new

564
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:00,800
information into it and this new
 

565
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,070
information into it and this new
information. So we'll just plug that

566
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:02,080
information. So we'll just plug that
 

567
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,430
information. So we'll just plug that
there. Plug this

568
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:04,440
there. Plug this
 

569
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,310
there. Plug this
here and you'll

570
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:07,320
here and you'll
 

571
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,910
here and you'll
notice we'll play with the W. It's doing

572
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:09,920
notice we'll play with the W. It's doing
 

573
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,750
notice we'll play with the W. It's doing
that. You'll notice it's doing that.

574
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:11,760
that. You'll notice it's doing that.
 

575
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,069
that. You'll notice it's doing that.
What we can do is just invert it with a

576
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:14,079
What we can do is just invert it with a
 

577
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,829
What we can do is just invert it with a
color ramp.

578
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:15,839
color ramp.
 

579
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,829
color ramp.
So plug that there and then just flip

580
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:17,839
So plug that there and then just flip
 

581
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,630
So plug that there and then just flip
the color ramp. So that's just inverting

582
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:20,640
the color ramp. So that's just inverting
 

583
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,470
the color ramp. So that's just inverting
that texture so we don't have to change

584
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:23,480
that texture so we don't have to change
 

585
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,230
that texture so we don't have to change
anything. And then now you have all of

586
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:26,240
anything. And then now you have all of
 

587
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,230
anything. And then now you have all of
this geometry. What I want to do is

588
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,240
this geometry. What I want to do is
 

589
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,470
this geometry. What I want to do is
convert all of these faces into uh

590
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:30,480
convert all of these faces into uh
 

591
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,310
convert all of these faces into uh
points. So I'm just going to take these

592
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:32,320
points. So I'm just going to take these
 

593
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,150
points. So I'm just going to take these
guys here, highlight them, and bring

594
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,160
guys here, highlight them, and bring
 

595
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,069
guys here, highlight them, and bring
them over a little bit. What I want to

596
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:36,079
them over a little bit. What I want to
 

597
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,150
them over a little bit. What I want to
do is to turn these faces into points.

598
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:38,160
do is to turn these faces into points.
 

599
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,550
do is to turn these faces into points.
And so that's very easy. You can just go

600
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:40,560
And so that's very easy. You can just go
 

601
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,790
And so that's very easy. You can just go
ahead and do a mesh to points and say

602
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:44,800
ahead and do a mesh to points and say
 

603
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,590
ahead and do a mesh to points and say
use the faces. And so now again, if you

604
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:47,600
use the faces. And so now again, if you
 

605
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,269
use the faces. And so now again, if you
play with that noise texture, we're just

606
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:49,279
play with that noise texture, we're just
 

607
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,509
play with that noise texture, we're just
getting points. And if I were to plug

608
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:51,519
getting points. And if I were to plug
 

609
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,990
getting points. And if I were to plug
this material set material into the

610
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:54,000
this material set material into the
 

611
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,110
this material set material into the
join, you'll

612
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:56,120
join, you'll
 

613
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:00,190
join, you'll
notice, see those points are on top of

614
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:00,200
notice, see those points are on top of
 

615
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,590
notice, see those points are on top of
each image square. So this is sort this

616
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:03,600
each image square. So this is sort this
 

617
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,590
each image square. So this is sort this
is just to confirm, hey, this is working

618
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:05,600
is just to confirm, hey, this is working
 

619
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,750
is just to confirm, hey, this is working
properly. And once these points connect,

620
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:07,760
properly. And once these points connect,
 

621
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,350
properly. And once these points connect,
this effect is going to work, right? So,

622
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:09,360
this effect is going to work, right? So,
 

623
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,550
this effect is going to work, right? So,
I'm just going to go ahead and sever

624
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:10,560
I'm just going to go ahead and sever
 

625
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,550
I'm just going to go ahead and sever
that and go back. What we need to do now

626
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:12,560
that and go back. What we need to do now
 

627
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,190
that and go back. What we need to do now
is to create a really kind of weird

628
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:15,200
is to create a really kind of weird
 

629
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,150
is to create a really kind of weird
setup of nodes to get every point here

630
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,160
setup of nodes to get every point here
 

631
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,430
setup of nodes to get every point here
to connect. So, I'm just going to go

632
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:19,440
to connect. So, I'm just going to go
 

633
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,949
to connect. So, I'm just going to go
ahead and play with my W till I have a

634
00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:20,959
ahead and play with my W till I have a
 

635
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,350
ahead and play with my W till I have a
few more points that we'll want to

636
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:22,360
few more points that we'll want to
 

637
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,870
few more points that we'll want to
connect. So, right after the mesh to

638
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:24,880
connect. So, right after the mesh to
 

639
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,710
connect. So, right after the mesh to
points node, let's go ahead and get a

640
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:26,720
points node, let's go ahead and get a
 

641
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,509
points node, let's go ahead and get a
for each element

642
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:28,519
for each element
 

643
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:30,550
for each element
node. And we're going to need two of

644
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:30,560
node. And we're going to need two of
 

645
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,990
node. And we're going to need two of
them. So, let's go ahead. I'm g sever

646
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,000
them. So, let's go ahead. I'm g sever
 

647
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,790
them. So, let's go ahead. I'm g sever
that points to geometry. And then this

648
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:34,800
that points to geometry. And then this
 

649
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,750
that points to geometry. And then this
lower green. Plug him there. And then

650
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:37,760
lower green. Plug him there. And then
 

651
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,470
lower green. Plug him there. And then
we're just going to get another for each

652
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:40,480
we're just going to get another for each
 

653
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,470
we're just going to get another for each
element node. And we're going to plug

654
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:42,480
element node. And we're going to plug
 

655
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,910
element node. And we're going to plug
this lower green into hem right there.

656
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:45,920
this lower green into hem right there.
 

657
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,030
this lower green into hem right there.
And here's what we're going to do now.

658
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,040
And here's what we're going to do now.
 

659
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,710
And here's what we're going to do now.
Let's go ahead and throw some data into

660
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:48,720
Let's go ahead and throw some data into
 

661
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,509
Let's go ahead and throw some data into
it to get all of those points to connect

662
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:51,519
it to get all of those points to connect
 

663
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,430
it to get all of those points to connect
each other with a curve. So, first we're

664
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:55,440
each other with a curve. So, first we're
 

665
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,590
each other with a curve. So, first we're
going to need a position node. And

666
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:57,600
going to need a position node. And
 

667
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,190
going to need a position node. And
because it's a for each element node,

668
00:11:59,190 --> 00:11:59,200
because it's a for each element node,
 

669
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,949
because it's a for each element node,
once we plug him into here, it's going

670
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:00,959
once we plug him into here, it's going
 

671
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,150
once we plug him into here, it's going
to create a position some position data

672
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:04,160
to create a position some position data
 

673
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,949
to create a position some position data
for each one of those points that we

674
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:06,959
for each one of those points that we
 

675
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,710
for each one of those points that we
generated. Let's go ahead and get a

676
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:08,720
generated. Let's go ahead and get a
 

677
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,550
generated. Let's go ahead and get a
curve line node. Curve line. And the

678
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:12,560
curve line node. Curve line. And the
 

679
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,910
curve line node. Curve line. And the
this point we're going to get the

680
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:13,920
this point we're going to get the
 

681
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,310
this point we're going to get the
position of each point into the start of

682
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:16,320
position of each point into the start of
 

683
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,870
position of each point into the start of
the curve line. So one end of the curve,

684
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:18,880
the curve line. So one end of the curve,
 

685
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,870
the curve line. So one end of the curve,
we're saying, hey, start there. Now, we

686
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:20,880
we're saying, hey, start there. Now, we
 

687
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,870
we're saying, hey, start there. Now, we
need to get the other end of the curve

688
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:22,880
need to get the other end of the curve
 

689
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,110
need to get the other end of the curve
to also connect to everything. So, I'm

690
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:25,120
to also connect to everything. So, I'm
 

691
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,710
to also connect to everything. So, I'm
just going to go ahead and give myself a

692
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:26,720
just going to go ahead and give myself a
 

693
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,150
just going to go ahead and give myself a
little bit more space. I'm highlighting

694
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:28,160
little bit more space. I'm highlighting
 

695
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,629
little bit more space. I'm highlighting
and hitting G. Now, we're going to need

696
00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:30,639
and hitting G. Now, we're going to need
 

697
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,590
and hitting G. Now, we're going to need
to get a

698
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:32,600
to get a
 

699
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,430
to get a
sample index node. We're going to get

700
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:35,440
sample index node. We're going to get
 

701
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,829
sample index node. We're going to get
another position node. We're going to

702
00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:37,839
another position node. We're going to
 

703
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,389
another position node. We're going to
switch this over to a vector. Plug

704
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:40,399
switch this over to a vector. Plug
 

705
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,030
switch this over to a vector. Plug
position into value. The mesh to points

706
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,040
position into value. The mesh to points
 

707
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,629
position into value. The mesh to points
is going to go here, right here into the

708
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:44,639
is going to go here, right here into the
 

709
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,949
is going to go here, right here into the
geometry. And then the element right

710
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:46,959
geometry. And then the element right
 

711
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,430
geometry. And then the element right
here into the geometry. And then he is

712
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:49,440
here into the geometry. And then he is
 

713
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,430
here into the geometry. And then he is
going to represent the end of the curve.

714
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:51,440
going to represent the end of the curve.
 

715
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,550
going to represent the end of the curve.
And then we're just going to plug this

716
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:52,560
And then we're just going to plug this
 

717
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,590
And then we're just going to plug this
curve line into geometry. And now all of

718
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:55,600
curve line into geometry. And now all of
 

719
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,829
curve line into geometry. And now all of
them connect. So it's kind of a weird

720
00:12:57,829 --> 00:12:57,839
them connect. So it's kind of a weird
 

721
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,670
them connect. So it's kind of a weird
convoluted mess of nodes. If you

722
00:12:59,670 --> 00:12:59,680
convoluted mess of nodes. If you
 

723
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,110
convoluted mess of nodes. If you
recognize the setup, I actually did a

724
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:01,120
recognize the setup, I actually did a
 

725
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,030
recognize the setup, I actually did a
tutorial on it earlier and it created

726
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:03,040
tutorial on it earlier and it created
 

727
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,110
tutorial on it earlier and it created
this animation. So that very much goes

728
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:05,120
this animation. So that very much goes
 

729
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,470
this animation. So that very much goes
to show same process, highly different

730
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:08,480
to show same process, highly different
 

731
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,629
to show same process, highly different
result, similar idea. So you can really

732
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:10,639
result, similar idea. So you can really
 

733
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,389
result, similar idea. So you can really
take really cool things like this and

734
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:12,399
take really cool things like this and
 

735
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,990
take really cool things like this and
use them for other things. And that's

736
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:14,000
use them for other things. And that's
 

737
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,269
use them for other things. And that's
where you can start to take these

738
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:15,279
where you can start to take these
 

739
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,190
where you can start to take these
processes and go, "Oh, I recognize that

740
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:17,200
processes and go, "Oh, I recognize that
 

741
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,790
processes and go, "Oh, I recognize that
all these things are connected. I

742
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:18,800
all these things are connected. I
 

743
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,230
all these things are connected. I
recognize that node setup. I'm going to

744
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:20,240
recognize that node setup. I'm going to
 

745
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,990
recognize that node setup. I'm going to
use it in this completely different way.

746
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:22,000
use it in this completely different way.
 

747
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,629
use it in this completely different way.
And that's how you can really creatively

748
00:13:23,629 --> 00:13:23,639
And that's how you can really creatively
 

749
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:25,829
And that's how you can really creatively
use setups like this that are very

750
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:25,839
use setups like this that are very
 

751
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,350
use setups like this that are very
technical, but you can be very artistic

752
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:27,360
technical, but you can be very artistic
 

753
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,269
technical, but you can be very artistic
with their use case. Now that we have

754
00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:29,279
with their use case. Now that we have
 

755
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,629
with their use case. Now that we have
all these connected, there's some stuff

756
00:13:30,629 --> 00:13:30,639
all these connected, there's some stuff
 

757
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,389
all these connected, there's some stuff
going on that may not be entirely

758
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:32,399
going on that may not be entirely
 

759
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,110
going on that may not be entirely
visual. But

760
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:34,120
visual. But
 

761
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,629
visual. But
essentially, you may see one curve.

762
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:36,639
essentially, you may see one curve.
 

763
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,310
essentially, you may see one curve.
There's really, I believe, three. One

764
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:38,320
There's really, I believe, three. One
 

765
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,750
There's really, I believe, three. One
going there, one going back, one going

766
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:39,760
going there, one going back, one going
 

767
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,430
going there, one going back, one going
back. So, you have some duplicates

768
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:41,440
back. So, you have some duplicates
 

769
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,949
back. So, you have some duplicates
that's going to create extra geometry.

770
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:42,959
that's going to create extra geometry.
 

771
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,670
that's going to create extra geometry.
So, I want to just go ahead and delete

772
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:45,680
So, I want to just go ahead and delete
 

773
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,670
So, I want to just go ahead and delete
the curves that are overlapping because

774
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:47,680
the curves that are overlapping because
 

775
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,190
the curves that are overlapping because
you can't even see it. And once we turn

776
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:49,200
you can't even see it. And once we turn
 

777
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,949
you can't even see it. And once we turn
it into geometry, it's going to be three

778
00:13:50,949 --> 00:13:50,959
it into geometry, it's going to be three
 

779
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,949
it into geometry, it's going to be three
times the geometry we need. So what

780
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:52,959
times the geometry we need. So what
 

781
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:57,150
times the geometry we need. So what
we'll do is convert it to a

782
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:57,160

 

783
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,310

mesh. We'll do a curve to mesh. And this

784
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:00,320
mesh. We'll do a curve to mesh. And this
 

785
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,629
mesh. We'll do a curve to mesh. And this
isn't to create that wireframe effect

786
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:02,639
isn't to create that wireframe effect
 

787
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,470
isn't to create that wireframe effect
that I'm normally doing with this node.

788
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:04,480
that I'm normally doing with this node.
 

789
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,550
that I'm normally doing with this node.
It's simply to turn it into a

790
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:07,560
It's simply to turn it into a
 

791
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,629
It's simply to turn it into a
mesh and allow us to use this merge by

792
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:10,639
mesh and allow us to use this merge by
 

793
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,550
mesh and allow us to use this merge by
distance. And what that's going to do is

794
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:12,560
distance. And what that's going to do is
 

795
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,030
distance. And what that's going to do is
just kill that duplicate curve. You

796
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:15,040
just kill that duplicate curve. You
 

797
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,310
just kill that duplicate curve. You
couldn't see it visually, but in the

798
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:16,320
couldn't see it visually, but in the
 

799
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,430
couldn't see it visually, but in the
data you would be able to recognize

800
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:17,440
data you would be able to recognize
 

801
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,189
data you would be able to recognize
that. This just serves to delete the

802
00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:19,199
that. This just serves to delete the
 

803
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,590
that. This just serves to delete the
redundant curve. Now, what I'm going to

804
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:21,600
redundant curve. Now, what I'm going to
 

805
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,350
redundant curve. Now, what I'm going to
do is get in a mesh to

806
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:26,360

 

807
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,350

curve and then a curve to

808
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:30,360
curve and then a curve to
 

809
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,389
curve and then a curve to
mesh. And then you get a curve

810
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:33,399
mesh. And then you get a curve
 

811
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:35,430
mesh. And then you get a curve
circle. Feel like I say this every time,

812
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:35,440
circle. Feel like I say this every time,
 

813
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,870
circle. Feel like I say this every time,
but we've done this a thousand times on

814
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:36,880
but we've done this a thousand times on
 

815
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,110
but we've done this a thousand times on
the channel. We're creating a wireframe.

816
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:39,120
the channel. We're creating a wireframe.
 

817
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,590
the channel. We're creating a wireframe.
And you just plug that there. And now we

818
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:41,600
And you just plug that there. And now we
 

819
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,150
And you just plug that there. And now we
bring that radius down. You now have

820
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:44,160
bring that radius down. You now have
 

821
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,470
bring that radius down. You now have
this. So, what we can do is take this

822
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:46,480
this. So, what we can do is take this
 

823
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,470
this. So, what we can do is take this
set

824
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:47,480
set
 

825
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,590
set
material node and just plug that into

826
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:49,600
material node and just plug that into
 

827
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,069
material node and just plug that into
the join geometry. And we're back. If

828
00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:52,079
the join geometry. And we're back. If
 

829
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,509
the join geometry. And we're back. If
you want to kind of just appreciate it

830
00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:53,519
you want to kind of just appreciate it
 

831
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,030
you want to kind of just appreciate it
and see it, you can play with that noise

832
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:55,040
and see it, you can play with that noise
 

833
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,269
and see it, you can play with that noise
texture. And now there's a curve.

834
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:57,279
texture. And now there's a curve.
 

835
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,829
texture. And now there's a curve.
There's a line connected to each one of

836
00:14:59,829 --> 00:14:59,839
There's a line connected to each one of
 

837
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,750
There's a line connected to each one of
those image cubes. So, I'm going to go

838
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:01,760
those image cubes. So, I'm going to go
 

839
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,350
those image cubes. So, I'm going to go
back here to the uh circle curve and I'm

840
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:05,360
back here to the uh circle curve and I'm
 

841
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,509
back here to the uh circle curve and I'm
just going to bring it pretty far down.

842
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:07,519
just going to bring it pretty far down.
 

843
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,870
just going to bring it pretty far down.
Something like that. And the resolution

844
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:08,880
Something like that. And the resolution
 

845
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,470
Something like that. And the resolution
of four is really all you're going to

846
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:10,480
of four is really all you're going to
 

847
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,829
of four is really all you're going to
need cuz it's going to be extremely

848
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:11,839
need cuz it's going to be extremely
 

849
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,910
need cuz it's going to be extremely
thin. geometry isn't going to be very

850
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:13,920
thin. geometry isn't going to be very
 

851
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,150
thin. geometry isn't going to be very
noticeable. Now it's white. It's just

852
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:16,160
noticeable. Now it's white. It's just
 

853
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,870
noticeable. Now it's white. It's just
white by default. What you can do is get

854
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:17,880
white by default. What you can do is get
 

855
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:22,230
white by default. What you can do is get
a set material node. Go over here. Click

856
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:22,240
a set material node. Go over here. Click
 

857
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,829
a set material node. Go over here. Click
new. We're going to switch it over to an

858
00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:23,839
new. We're going to switch it over to an
 

859
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,110
new. We're going to switch it over to an
emission node and just make it a nice

860
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,120
emission node and just make it a nice
 

861
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,790
emission node and just make it a nice
red. And then just go ahead and grab

862
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:28,800
red. And then just go ahead and grab
 

863
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,150
red. And then just go ahead and grab
that red right there. And now we have

864
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:30,160
that red right there. And now we have
 

865
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,750
that red right there. And now we have
these red lines. I'm going to go say

866
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:31,760
these red lines. I'm going to go say
 

867
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,189
these red lines. I'm going to go say
maybe 05 might be good. I would even go

868
00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:35,199
maybe 05 might be good. I would even go
 

869
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,110
maybe 05 might be good. I would even go
even

870
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:36,120
even
 

871
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,150
even
uh thinner on this. And then we need one

872
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:40,160
uh thinner on this. And then we need one
 

873
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,269
uh thinner on this. And then we need one
more thing. I want to have these little

874
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:41,279
more thing. I want to have these little
 

875
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,870
more thing. I want to have these little
cubes, um, these little planes at each

876
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:43,880
cubes, um, these little planes at each
 

877
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,389
cubes, um, these little planes at each
connection. So, what I'm going to do is

878
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:46,399
connection. So, what I'm going to do is
 

879
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,230
connection. So, what I'm going to do is
right here on the node that says mesh to

880
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:48,240
right here on the node that says mesh to
 

881
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,790
right here on the node that says mesh to
points. What I'm going to

882
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:49,800
points. What I'm going to
 

883
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,910
points. What I'm going to
do, we're going to get an instance on

884
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:51,920
do, we're going to get an instance on
 

885
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,550
do, we're going to get an instance on
points

886
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:53,560
points
 

887
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:57,350
points
node and just plug him into the points.

888
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:57,360
node and just plug him into the points.
 

889
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,910
node and just plug him into the points.
Plug him into the join

890
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:00,920

 

891
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:06,509

geometry and get a

892
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:06,519

 

893
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:08,310

grid. And you're not going to see

894
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:08,320
grid. And you're not going to see
 

895
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,590
grid. And you're not going to see
anything. It needs to be we're going to

896
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:09,600
anything. It needs to be we're going to
 

897
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,629
anything. It needs to be we're going to
get a transform geometry node just to

898
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:12,639
get a transform geometry node just to
 

899
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,670
get a transform geometry node just to
kind of bring it up a slight bit so that

900
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:15,680
kind of bring it up a slight bit so that
 

901
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,470
kind of bring it up a slight bit so that
we can see it. And then you can just go

902
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:18,480
we can see it. And then you can just go
 

903
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,829
we can see it. And then you can just go
also put that same

904
00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:20,839
also put that same
 

905
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:25,389
also put that same
material on that. So now we have the

906
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:25,399
material on that. So now we have the
 

907
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:27,749
material on that. So now we have the
finished effect. If you go back to sort

908
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:27,759
finished effect. If you go back to sort
 

909
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,949
finished effect. If you go back to sort
of the master

910
00:16:29,949 --> 00:16:29,959
of the master
 

911
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:33,269
of the master
noise, you can now see and appreciate

912
00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:33,279
noise, you can now see and appreciate
 

913
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,829
noise, you can now see and appreciate
this effect. And all we need to do is

914
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:35,839
this effect. And all we need to do is
 

915
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,910
this effect. And all we need to do is
animate it. Uh because we kind of I like

916
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:37,920
animate it. Uh because we kind of I like
 

917
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,430
animate it. Uh because we kind of I like
to go the extra mile and loop the

918
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:39,440
to go the extra mile and loop the
 

919
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,670
to go the extra mile and loop the
animation. We're going to loop the W and

920
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:41,680
animation. We're going to loop the W and
 

921
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,590
animation. We're going to loop the W and
the noise. And so we have our timeline

922
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:43,600
the noise. And so we have our timeline
 

923
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,189
the noise. And so we have our timeline
down here. I'm going to stick with 250

924
00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:45,199
down here. I'm going to stick with 250
 

925
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,670
down here. I'm going to stick with 250
frames. That's going to give you about I

926
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:47,680
frames. That's going to give you about I
 

927
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,509
frames. That's going to give you about I
think a 10-second animation if I'm

928
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:49,519
think a 10-second animation if I'm
 

929
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,749
think a 10-second animation if I'm
remembering right. And so I'm going to

930
00:16:51,749 --> 00:16:51,759
remembering right. And so I'm going to
 

931
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,749
remembering right. And so I'm going to
go ahead and bring my W to zero. I'm

932
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:55,759
go ahead and bring my W to zero. I'm
 

933
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,389
go ahead and bring my W to zero. I'm
going to duplicate the noise. Get a mix

934
00:16:58,389 --> 00:16:58,399
going to duplicate the noise. Get a mix
 

935
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,590
going to duplicate the noise. Get a mix
color node. Mix color node. And plug

936
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:01,600
color node. Mix color node. And plug
 

937
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,189
color node. Mix color node. And plug
factor there. And bring the factor over

938
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:03,199
factor there. And bring the factor over
 

939
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,590
factor there. And bring the factor over
to the left. So right here on the W, you

940
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:05,600
to the left. So right here on the W, you
 

941
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,829
to the left. So right here on the W, you
hit I to add a key frame. Hit I on the

942
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:07,839
hit I to add a key frame. Hit I on the
 

943
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,630
hit I to add a key frame. Hit I on the
factor. And then we're going to go to

944
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:10,640
factor. And then we're going to go to
 

945
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,230
factor. And then we're going to go to
the very end. And I'm going to say

946
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:12,240
the very end. And I'm going to say
 

947
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,270
the very end. And I'm going to say
probably a value of

948
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:14,280
probably a value of
 

949
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,029
probably a value of
five. And then we're going to slide this

950
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:17,039
five. And then we're going to slide this
 

951
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,270
five. And then we're going to slide this
guy over and hit I. Hit I. Now that

952
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:19,280
guy over and hit I. Hit I. Now that
 

953
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,669
guy over and hit I. Hit I. Now that
we're at the very end of the animation,

954
00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:21,679
we're at the very end of the animation,
 

955
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,789
we're at the very end of the animation,
hit your W. He should be zero. Go back

956
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:24,799
hit your W. He should be zero. Go back
 

957
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,510
hit your W. He should be zero. Go back
to frame zero and do

958
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:28,520
to frame zero and do
 

959
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,310
to frame zero and do
five. And there we go. Now we used a

960
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:32,320
five. And there we go. Now we used a
 

961
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,990
five. And there we go. Now we used a
value of five and neg 5. If you want it

962
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:34,000
value of five and neg 5. If you want it
 

963
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,830
value of five and neg 5. If you want it
faster, do like 10 negative 10. If you

964
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:35,840
faster, do like 10 negative 10. If you
 

965
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,310
faster, do like 10 negative 10. If you
want it slower, do

966
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:37,320
want it slower, do
 

967
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,029
want it slower, do
like.5gative.5. You kind of get the

968
00:17:39,029 --> 00:17:39,039
like.5gative.5. You kind of get the
 

969
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,350
like.5gative.5. You kind of get the
idea. But your values are going to

970
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:41,360
idea. But your values are going to
 

971
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,350
idea. But your values are going to
create the speed of the animation. So,

972
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:43,360
create the speed of the animation. So,
 

973
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,830
create the speed of the animation. So,
that's really going to dictate um how it

974
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:45,840
that's really going to dictate um how it
 

975
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,070
that's really going to dictate um how it
looks. I would render this in the Eevee

976
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:48,080
looks. I would render this in the Eevee
 

977
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,510
looks. I would render this in the Eevee
render engine. I think I'm in cycles

978
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:49,520
render engine. I think I'm in cycles
 

979
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,830
render engine. I think I'm in cycles
right now. Yeah. Just switch over to

980
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:50,840
right now. Yeah. Just switch over to
 

981
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:54,950
right now. Yeah. Just switch over to
Eevee. Press play. And you now have a

982
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:54,960
Eevee. Press play. And you now have a
 

983
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,190
Eevee. Press play. And you now have a
really, really cool finished interesting

984
00:17:59,190 --> 00:17:59,200
really, really cool finished interesting
 

985
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,070
really, really cool finished interesting
looking touch designer effect. Um, and

986
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:02,080
looking touch designer effect. Um, and
 

987
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,990
looking touch designer effect. Um, and
all points connect to all points. It's

988
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:04,000
all points connect to all points. It's
 

989
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,630
all points connect to all points. It's
really cool. It's pretty useful. Um,

990
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:06,640
really cool. It's pretty useful. Um,
 

991
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,909
really cool. It's pretty useful. Um,
especially just having some fun and

992
00:18:07,909 --> 00:18:07,919
especially just having some fun and
 

993
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,350
especially just having some fun and
glitching some things around. So, there

994
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:09,360
glitching some things around. So, there
 

995
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,590
glitching some things around. So, there
you go. That is the full animation. You

996
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:11,600
you go. That is the full animation. You
 

997
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,270
you go. That is the full animation. You
