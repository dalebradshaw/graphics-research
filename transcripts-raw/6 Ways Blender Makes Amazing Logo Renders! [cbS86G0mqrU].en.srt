00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,470

There's hundreds of directions you can

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:02,480
There's hundreds of directions you can
 

3
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,670
There's hundreds of directions you can
go uh in 3D if you want to take logos

4
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:05,680
go uh in 3D if you want to take logos
 

5
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,349
go uh in 3D if you want to take logos
and bring them to life because at the

6
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:07,359
and bring them to life because at the
 

7
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:08,390
and bring them to life because at the
end of the day we're playing with

8
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:08,400
end of the day we're playing with
 

9
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,549
end of the day we're playing with
geometry. It's just in the shape of a

10
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:10,559
geometry. It's just in the shape of a
 

11
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,110
geometry. It's just in the shape of a
logo. But this week I wanted to take six

12
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:13,120
logo. But this week I wanted to take six
 

13
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,589
logo. But this week I wanted to take six
ideas and make something really cool

14
00:00:15,589 --> 00:00:15,599
ideas and make something really cool
 

15
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,430
ideas and make something really cool
with them. Ended up making some really

16
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:17,440
with them. Ended up making some really
 

17
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,109
with them. Ended up making some really
cool animations and a couple still

18
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:19,119
cool animations and a couple still
 

19
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,510
cool animations and a couple still
images. So, what I want to do today is

20
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:21,520
images. So, what I want to do today is
 

21
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,670
images. So, what I want to do today is
show you the bones, the concept of how

22
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:23,680
show you the bones, the concept of how
 

23
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,790
show you the bones, the concept of how
to do those processes in Blender and

24
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:26,800
to do those processes in Blender and
 

25
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,150
to do those processes in Blender and
just show you enough to where you can

26
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:28,160
just show you enough to where you can
 

27
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,070
just show you enough to where you can
take them and then make them your own

28
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:30,080
take them and then make them your own
 

29
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,750
take them and then make them your own
with your own ideas and how to take

30
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:31,760
with your own ideas and how to take
 

31
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,750
with your own ideas and how to take
those ideas and go further with them

32
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:33,760
those ideas and go further with them
 

33
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,510
those ideas and go further with them
with your own creativity. The first

34
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:35,520
with your own creativity. The first
 

35
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,350
with your own creativity. The first
concept is taking your geometry,

36
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:37,360
concept is taking your geometry,
 

37
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,190
concept is taking your geometry,
converting it to a volume so that you

38
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:39,200
converting it to a volume so that you
 

39
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,270
converting it to a volume so that you
can then displace it in really cool ways

40
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:41,280
can then displace it in really cool ways
 

41
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,630
can then displace it in really cool ways
that goes beyond your typical

42
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:42,640
that goes beyond your typical
 

43
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,709
that goes beyond your typical
displacement modifier. and then we're

44
00:00:44,709 --> 00:00:44,719
displacement modifier. and then we're
 

45
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,470
displacement modifier. and then we're
going to convert it back into geometry

46
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:46,480
going to convert it back into geometry
 

47
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,709
going to convert it back into geometry
so that you can add materials, lighting,

48
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:48,719
so that you can add materials, lighting,
 

49
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,709
so that you can add materials, lighting,
anything you want to do it past that.

50
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:50,719
anything you want to do it past that.
 

51
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,389
anything you want to do it past that.
The second one is conceptually very

52
00:00:52,389 --> 00:00:52,399
The second one is conceptually very
 

53
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,389
The second one is conceptually very
simple. You're taking just an image of

54
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:54,399
simple. You're taking just an image of
 

55
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,150
simple. You're taking just an image of
your logo, black and white, throwing it

56
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:56,160
your logo, black and white, throwing it
 

57
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,750
your logo, black and white, throwing it
in Blender, and manipulating it with

58
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:57,760
in Blender, and manipulating it with
 

59
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,069
in Blender, and manipulating it with
procedural textures to create this

60
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:00,079
procedural textures to create this
 

61
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,229
procedural textures to create this
transitioning morphing effect with

62
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:02,239
transitioning morphing effect with
 

63
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,510
transitioning morphing effect with
anything you want to do. It's very

64
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:03,520
anything you want to do. It's very
 

65
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,750
anything you want to do. It's very
powerful, but very simple to execute.

66
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:05,760
powerful, but very simple to execute.
 

67
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,429
powerful, but very simple to execute.
This might be my favorite one. Uh, but

68
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:07,439
This might be my favorite one. Uh, but
 

69
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,190
This might be my favorite one. Uh, but
we're taking a logo and able to control

70
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:09,200
we're taking a logo and able to control
 

71
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,190
we're taking a logo and able to control
the emission outwards and inwards

72
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:12,200
the emission outwards and inwards
 

73
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,789
the emission outwards and inwards
independently to make a really cool

74
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:14,799
independently to make a really cool
 

75
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,429
independently to make a really cool
animation. Fourth concept is just being

76
00:01:17,429 --> 00:01:17,439
animation. Fourth concept is just being
 

77
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,429
animation. Fourth concept is just being
able to fill the inside of your logo

78
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:19,439
able to fill the inside of your logo
 

79
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,350
able to fill the inside of your logo
with objects. I'm going to show you two

80
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:21,360
with objects. I'm going to show you two
 

81
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,109
with objects. I'm going to show you two
methods. One that helps you fill it

82
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:23,119
methods. One that helps you fill it
 

83
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,710
methods. One that helps you fill it
really well. Another method that allows

84
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:24,720
really well. Another method that allows
 

85
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,870
really well. Another method that allows
you some space to animate those points.

86
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:26,880
you some space to animate those points.
 

87
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,910
you some space to animate those points.
Then I'm going to show you how to take

88
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:27,920
Then I'm going to show you how to take
 

89
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,990
Then I'm going to show you how to take
the black and white image of a logo, use

90
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:30,000
the black and white image of a logo, use
 

91
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,990
the black and white image of a logo, use
it as a mask in geometry node. So, we

92
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:32,000
it as a mask in geometry node. So, we
 

93
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,390
it as a mask in geometry node. So, we
can delete things, scale things, really

94
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:34,400
can delete things, scale things, really
 

95
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,870
can delete things, scale things, really
show you how to take an image, map it in

96
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:36,880
show you how to take an image, map it in
 

97
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,469
show you how to take an image, map it in
Geometry Nodes, and then you can take

98
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:38,479
Geometry Nodes, and then you can take
 

99
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,469
Geometry Nodes, and then you can take
your further Geometry Nodes knowledge to

100
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:40,479
your further Geometry Nodes knowledge to
 

101
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,109
your further Geometry Nodes knowledge to
do whatever you want under that idea.

102
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:43,119
do whatever you want under that idea.
 

103
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,469
do whatever you want under that idea.
And the last one, I'm going to show you

104
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:44,479
And the last one, I'm going to show you
 

105
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,109
And the last one, I'm going to show you
the quickest way to add fur to a logo

106
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:47,119
the quickest way to add fur to a logo
 

107
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,590
the quickest way to add fur to a logo
and make it look really good very, very

108
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:49,600
and make it look really good very, very
 

109
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,590
and make it look really good very, very
quickly. So, we're going to get into all

110
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:51,600
quickly. So, we're going to get into all
 

111
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,270
quickly. So, we're going to get into all
of those right now. Before that, I want

112
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:53,280
of those right now. Before that, I want

134
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:13,760
said, let's get into these concepts.
 

135
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,910
said, let's get into these concepts.
Okay, so concept one, taking geometry,

136
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:15,920
Okay, so concept one, taking geometry,
 

137
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,430
Okay, so concept one, taking geometry,
converting it to volumes, and being able

138
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:17,440
converting it to volumes, and being able
 

139
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,350
converting it to volumes, and being able
to displace and sort of manipulate it

140
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:19,360
to displace and sort of manipulate it
 

141
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,430
to displace and sort of manipulate it
that way. First, we are going to need

142
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:21,440
that way. First, we are going to need
 

143
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,070
that way. First, we are going to need
the SVG of a logo. Um, but what you'll

144
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:24,080
the SVG of a logo. Um, but what you'll
 

145
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,190
the SVG of a logo. Um, but what you'll
do is you just import and click on SVG.

146
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:27,200
do is you just import and click on SVG.
 

147
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,790
do is you just import and click on SVG.
And I'm going to grab the Blender logo.

148
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:28,800
And I'm going to grab the Blender logo.
 

149
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,150
And I'm going to grab the Blender logo.
So, we have the logo. First thing we

150
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,160
So, we have the logo. First thing we
 

151
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,229
So, we have the logo. First thing we
need to do is add some thickness to it.

152
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:32,239
need to do is add some thickness to it.
 

153
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,390
need to do is add some thickness to it.
Because it is currently a curve, you can

154
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:34,400
Because it is currently a curve, you can
 

155
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,390
Because it is currently a curve, you can
go ahead in the geometry section and

156
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:36,400
go ahead in the geometry section and
 

157
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,550
go ahead in the geometry section and
extrude that. And this is all we're

158
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:38,560
extrude that. And this is all we're
 

159
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,509
extrude that. And this is all we're
going to need to do. And I'm just going

160
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:39,519
going to need to do. And I'm just going
 

161
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,990
going to need to do. And I'm just going
to go ahead and convert it to a mesh.

162
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,000
to go ahead and convert it to a mesh.
 

163
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,070
to go ahead and convert it to a mesh.
Now, we have real geometry. Now, I'm

164
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,080
Now, we have real geometry. Now, I'm
 

165
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,670
Now, we have real geometry. Now, I'm
going to hide that. And the first step

166
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:45,680
going to hide that. And the first step
 

167
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,910
going to hide that. And the first step
to converting this into a volume is in

168
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:47,920
to converting this into a volume is in
 

169
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,070
to converting this into a volume is in
the volume settings, go ahead and create

170
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,080
the volume settings, go ahead and create
 

171
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,309
the volume settings, go ahead and create
an empty. And that is going to give you

172
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:52,319
an empty. And that is going to give you
 

173
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,710
an empty. And that is going to give you
a subset of modifiers you now have

174
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:54,720
a subset of modifiers you now have
 

175
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,430
a subset of modifiers you now have
access to. We can search up a mesh to

176
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:57,440
access to. We can search up a mesh to
 

177
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,990
access to. We can search up a mesh to
volume node and then you can grab that

178
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,000
volume node and then you can grab that
 

179
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,110
volume node and then you can grab that
logo and you can start to see it show

180
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:01,120
logo and you can start to see it show
 

181
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,949
logo and you can start to see it show
up. You bring up that density and then

182
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:02,959
up. You bring up that density and then
 

183
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,869
up. You bring up that density and then
you can bring up that voxil amount. We

184
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:04,879
you can bring up that voxil amount. We
 

185
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,830
you can bring up that voxil amount. We
now have a volume version of the logo

186
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:07,840
now have a volume version of the logo
 

187
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,830
now have a volume version of the logo
and if you are in cycles you quite

188
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:09,840
and if you are in cycles you quite
 

189
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,430
and if you are in cycles you quite
literally have now a volume version of

190
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:13,440
literally have now a volume version of
 

191
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,190
literally have now a volume version of
this logo. Like already this is a cool

192
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:15,200
this logo. Like already this is a cool
 

193
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,790
this logo. Like already this is a cool
concept. Now we're going to get a volume

194
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:16,800
concept. Now we're going to get a volume
 

195
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,710
concept. Now we're going to get a volume
displace. So search that up. Volume

196
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:18,720
displace. So search that up. Volume
 

197
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,630
displace. So search that up. Volume
displace. This is going to allow you to

198
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:20,640
displace. This is going to allow you to
 

199
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,949
displace. This is going to allow you to
now throw textures on this just like a

200
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:22,959
now throw textures on this just like a
 

201
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,309
now throw textures on this just like a
displacement texture. So, we'll go into

202
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:26,319
displacement texture. So, we'll go into
 

203
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,229
displacement texture. So, we'll go into
the textures and I'm going to do

204
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:28,239
the textures and I'm going to do
 

205
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,430
the textures and I'm going to do
distorted noise. And we now have this.

206
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:31,440
distorted noise. And we now have this.
 

207
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,550
distorted noise. And we now have this.
Again, if we pop back into cycles, it's

208
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:34,560
Again, if we pop back into cycles, it's
 

209
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,630
Again, if we pop back into cycles, it's
pretty cool. Now, keep in mind your

210
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:36,640
pretty cool. Now, keep in mind your
 

211
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,390
pretty cool. Now, keep in mind your
voxil amount. I have it at 500, which is

212
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:38,400
voxil amount. I have it at 500, which is
 

213
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,990
voxil amount. I have it at 500, which is
way too much just to show you guys

214
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:40,000
way too much just to show you guys
 

215
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,670
way too much just to show you guys
what's going on. Let me just pop it down

216
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:41,680
what's going on. Let me just pop it down
 

217
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,670
what's going on. Let me just pop it down
to 200. We can go ahead and play with

218
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:43,680
to 200. We can go ahead and play with
 

219
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,869
to 200. We can go ahead and play with
that size. The strength is quite a

220
00:03:47,869 --> 00:03:47,879
that size. The strength is quite a
 

221
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:50,229
that size. The strength is quite a
lot right now. So, we'll maybe bring it

222
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:50,239
lot right now. So, we'll maybe bring it
 

223
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,309
lot right now. So, we'll maybe bring it
down to something like this. Now what I

224
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:52,319
down to something like this. Now what I
 

225
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,990
down to something like this. Now what I
can do is convert it back to geometry.

226
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,000
can do is convert it back to geometry.
 

227
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,509
can do is convert it back to geometry.
So what we'll do is we'll just add a

228
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:57,519
So what we'll do is we'll just add a
 

229
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,309
So what we'll do is we'll just add a
geometry nodes modifier and then open

230
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:00,319
geometry nodes modifier and then open
 

231
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,350
geometry nodes modifier and then open
that up and then there is a volume to

232
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:03,360
that up and then there is a volume to
 

233
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,070
that up and then there is a volume to
mesh node. Volume to mesh that is going

234
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:06,080
mesh node. Volume to mesh that is going
 

235
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,190
mesh node. Volume to mesh that is going
to convert it back. It looks pretty

236
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:09,200
to convert it back. It looks pretty
 

237
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,070
to convert it back. It looks pretty
insane. We can fix that with a set shade

238
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:12,080
insane. We can fix that with a set shade
 

239
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,990
insane. We can fix that with a set shade
smooth node. And then you can see it's

240
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,000
smooth node. And then you can see it's
 

241
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,710
smooth node. And then you can see it's
still kind of steppy if that's a proper

242
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:16,720
still kind of steppy if that's a proper
 

243
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,229
still kind of steppy if that's a proper
word. I'm gonna bring my voxil amount to

244
00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:18,239
word. I'm gonna bring my voxil amount to
 

245
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,670
word. I'm gonna bring my voxil amount to
like 400. You could see that. I think

246
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:21,680
like 400. You could see that. I think
 

247
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,590
like 400. You could see that. I think
it's cool, but it's not on purpose. So,

248
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:23,600
it's cool, but it's not on purpose. So,
 

249
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,510
it's cool, but it's not on purpose. So,
you just bring that threshold up. Then

250
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:25,520
you just bring that threshold up. Then
 

251
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,030
you just bring that threshold up. Then
you can head back to the texture and

252
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:27,040
you can head back to the texture and
 

253
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,590
you can head back to the texture and
start to just play with some stuff. Uh I

254
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:30,600
start to just play with some stuff. Uh I
 

255
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,870
start to just play with some stuff. Uh I
would play with the contrast

256
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:32,880
would play with the contrast
 

257
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,629
would play with the contrast
specifically cuz I want to get these

258
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:34,639
specifically cuz I want to get these
 

259
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,270
specifically cuz I want to get these
holes in uh the scene. And then you can

260
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:37,280
holes in uh the scene. And then you can
 

261
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,909
holes in uh the scene. And then you can
maybe bring that size up. And now you

262
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:39,919
maybe bring that size up. And now you
 

263
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,990
maybe bring that size up. And now you
have something really really wild. I

264
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,000
have something really really wild. I
 

265
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,270
have something really really wild. I
find this volumeing and then texturing

266
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:45,280
find this volumeing and then texturing
 

267
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,350
find this volumeing and then texturing
uh to be very stable. And I really

268
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:47,360
uh to be very stable. And I really
 

269
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,270
uh to be very stable. And I really
really like this method. And you can

270
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:49,280
really like this method. And you can
 

271
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,150
really like this method. And you can
throw any texture within this on that.

272
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,160
throw any texture within this on that.
 

273
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,590
throw any texture within this on that.
So you can even mix them. We'll do maybe

274
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:53,600
So you can even mix them. We'll do maybe
 

275
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,749
So you can even mix them. We'll do maybe
do a cell noise. And now we have this

276
00:04:57,749 --> 00:04:57,759
do a cell noise. And now we have this
 

277
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,749
do a cell noise. And now we have this
very quickly. And it's it's pretty

278
00:04:59,749 --> 00:04:59,759
very quickly. And it's it's pretty
 

279
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,270
very quickly. And it's it's pretty
stable. You have like weird things like

280
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,280
stable. You have like weird things like
 

281
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,629
stable. You have like weird things like
this, but you can work with it. But that

282
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:02,639
this, but you can work with it. But that
 

283
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,230
this, but you can work with it. But that
is how you can create something really

284
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:04,240
is how you can create something really
 

285
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,870
is how you can create something really
really cool very quickly. Uh with

286
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:06,880
really cool very quickly. Uh with
 

287
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,629
really cool very quickly. Uh with
volumes. For this next thing, you are

288
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:08,639
volumes. For this next thing, you are
 

289
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,670
volumes. For this next thing, you are
going to need a black and white image of

290
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:11,680
going to need a black and white image of
 

291
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,670
going to need a black and white image of
your logo. Something like this. I'm

292
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:13,680
your logo. Something like this. I'm
 

293
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,670
your logo. Something like this. I'm
going to use uh the Nike logo. Um, but

294
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:15,680
going to use uh the Nike logo. Um, but
 

295
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,469
going to use uh the Nike logo. Um, but
get a PNG or JPEG of a black and white

296
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:18,479
get a PNG or JPEG of a black and white
 

297
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,029
get a PNG or JPEG of a black and white
image. Um, what we'll do now is I'm

298
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:21,039
image. Um, what we'll do now is I'm
 

299
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,469
image. Um, what we'll do now is I'm
going to go ahead on image mesh plane

300
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:24,479
going to go ahead on image mesh plane
 

301
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,270
going to go ahead on image mesh plane
and I'm going to grab my logo. So, I'm

302
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:27,280
and I'm going to grab my logo. So, I'm
 

303
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,870
and I'm going to grab my logo. So, I'm
going to scale it up and we're going to

304
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:28,880
going to scale it up and we're going to
 

305
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,950
going to scale it up and we're going to
open up a shader window and I'm going to

306
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:30,960
open up a shader window and I'm going to
 

307
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,029
open up a shader window and I'm going to
look at this in Eevee. So, now we have

308
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:33,039
look at this in Eevee. So, now we have
 

309
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,430
look at this in Eevee. So, now we have
this and we have a couple things that we

310
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:35,440
this and we have a couple things that we
 

311
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,110
this and we have a couple things that we
can do here. So, I'm just going to go

312
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,120
can do here. So, I'm just going to go
 

313
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,029
can do here. So, I'm just going to go
ahead and sever these connections. Give

314
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:39,039
ahead and sever these connections. Give
 

315
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,950
ahead and sever these connections. Give
myself an emission of 10 and we're going

316
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:40,960
myself an emission of 10 and we're going
 

317
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,909
myself an emission of 10 and we're going
to plug this guy right into color. And

318
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:43,919
to plug this guy right into color. And
 

319
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,029
to plug this guy right into color. And
off the bat, we need to invert it. So,

320
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:47,039
off the bat, we need to invert it. So,
 

321
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,189
off the bat, we need to invert it. So,
first you have some ugliness right

322
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:49,199
first you have some ugliness right
 

323
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,749
first you have some ugliness right
there. You can fix

324
00:05:50,749 --> 00:05:50,759
there. You can fix
 

325
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:55,430
there. You can fix
that with a color ramp set to constant.

326
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:55,440
that with a color ramp set to constant.
 

327
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,270
that with a color ramp set to constant.
That's going to fix that weird ugliness.

328
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,280
That's going to fix that weird ugliness.
 

329
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,350
That's going to fix that weird ugliness.
Can't explain it, but that is the case.

330
00:05:59,350 --> 00:05:59,360
Can't explain it, but that is the case.
 

331
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,870
Can't explain it, but that is the case.
So, here's what we can do. Go ahead and

332
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:00,880
So, here's what we can do. Go ahead and
 

333
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,469
So, here's what we can do. Go ahead and
get a mapping setup. Just a mapping node

334
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:02,479
get a mapping setup. Just a mapping node
 

335
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,629
get a mapping setup. Just a mapping node
and a texture coordinate. And we are

336
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:04,639
and a texture coordinate. And we are
 

337
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,830
and a texture coordinate. And we are
going to go ahead and throw a texture on

338
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:07,840
going to go ahead and throw a texture on
 

339
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,070
going to go ahead and throw a texture on
here. I'm going to use the Gabber

340
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,080
here. I'm going to use the Gabber
 

341
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,990
here. I'm going to use the Gabber
texture because I've never actually used

342
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,000
texture because I've never actually used
 

343
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,510
texture because I've never actually used
it on the YouTube channel yet. and it's

344
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:13,520
it on the YouTube channel yet. and it's
 

345
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,550
it on the YouTube channel yet. and it's
going to give you something really cool

346
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:14,560
going to give you something really cool
 

347
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,189
going to give you something really cool
like this. So now we've completely lost

348
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:17,199
like this. So now we've completely lost
 

349
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,270
like this. So now we've completely lost
the logo. So now I'm going to go ahead

350
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:19,280
the logo. So now I'm going to go ahead
 

351
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,469
the logo. So now I'm going to go ahead
and get in a mix color node to create a

352
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:22,479
and get in a mix color node to create a
 

353
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,830
and get in a mix color node to create a
bypass. So we can just say how much of

354
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:25,840
bypass. So we can just say how much of
 

355
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,029
bypass. So we can just say how much of
this texture are we actually wanting um

356
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:29,039
this texture are we actually wanting um
 

357
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,430
this texture are we actually wanting um
to see. So this is a really really cool

358
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:31,440
to see. So this is a really really cool
 

359
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,029
to see. So this is a really really cool
texture. Again, one that I've not talked

360
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:33,039
texture. Again, one that I've not talked
 

361
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,309
texture. Again, one that I've not talked
about, but you can change the

362
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:34,319
about, but you can change the
 

363
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,230
about, but you can change the
orientation to actually fit the shape of

364
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:36,240
orientation to actually fit the shape of
 

365
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,189
orientation to actually fit the shape of
the Nike logo. So when we morph it in,

366
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:39,199
the Nike logo. So when we morph it in,
 

367
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,350
the Nike logo. So when we morph it in,
it

368
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:40,360
it
 

369
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,629
it
actually makes more sense in terms of

370
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:42,639
actually makes more sense in terms of
 

371
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,950
actually makes more sense in terms of
this transition. Uh there's a lot of

372
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:44,960
this transition. Uh there's a lot of
 

373
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,629
this transition. Uh there's a lot of
really really cool things that you can

374
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:46,639
really really cool things that you can
 

375
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,670
really really cool things that you can
do uh with this texture. But look at

376
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:49,680
do uh with this texture. But look at
 

377
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,309
do uh with this texture. But look at
that. All we have to do is animate this

378
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:52,319
that. All we have to do is animate this
 

379
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,390
that. All we have to do is animate this
in. So let's go ahead. So I'm going to

380
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:54,400
in. So let's go ahead. So I'm going to
 

381
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,870
in. So let's go ahead. So I'm going to
go ahead and set up my camera just to

382
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:57,880
go ahead and set up my camera just to
 

383
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,790
go ahead and set up my camera just to
have most of the logo. I really like the

384
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:00,800
have most of the logo. I really like the
 

385
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,390
have most of the logo. I really like the
composition of cutting off part of the

386
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:02,400
composition of cutting off part of the
 

387
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,710
composition of cutting off part of the
logo. I think it looks really, really,

388
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:04,720
logo. I think it looks really, really,
 

389
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,309
logo. I think it looks really, really,
really cool. And then what I'm going to

390
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:06,319
really cool. And then what I'm going to
 

391
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,990
really cool. And then what I'm going to
do now is because we have kind of a high

392
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:10,000
do now is because we have kind of a high
 

393
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,670
do now is because we have kind of a high
emission, we can go into the

394
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:12,680
emission, we can go into the
 

395
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,550
emission, we can go into the
compositing right here. I'm going just

396
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:14,560
compositing right here. I'm going just
 

397
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,749
compositing right here. I'm going just
click use node and get a glare node. Set

398
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:17,759
click use node and get a glare node. Set
 

399
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,070
click use node and get a glare node. Set
it to bloom. And then we can go back to

400
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,080
it to bloom. And then we can go back to
 

401
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,710
it to bloom. And then we can go back to
layout. And I'm just going to go say

402
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:21,720
layout. And I'm just going to go say
 

403
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,230
layout. And I'm just going to go say
always. And then we can just make it

404
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:24,240
always. And then we can just make it
 

405
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,990
always. And then we can just make it
glow a little bit. And then you can

406
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:26,000
glow a little bit. And then you can
 

407
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,309
glow a little bit. And then you can
change the color of your logo here. Nike

408
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:30,319
change the color of your logo here. Nike
 

409
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,070
change the color of your logo here. Nike
does love red. So we'll do that. And

410
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:32,080
does love red. So we'll do that. And
 

411
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,510
does love red. So we'll do that. And
then all we have to do is just

412
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:34,520
then all we have to do is just
 

413
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,350
then all we have to do is just
animate this factor to whatever extent

414
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:37,360
animate this factor to whatever extent
 

415
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,710
animate this factor to whatever extent
you want it to start. Maybe something

416
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:38,720
you want it to start. Maybe something
 

417
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,950
you want it to start. Maybe something
like that looks really cool. So I'm

418
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:40,960
like that looks really cool. So I'm
 

419
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,870
like that looks really cool. So I'm
going to go ahead. You'll just hit I on

420
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:42,880
going to go ahead. You'll just hit I on
 

421
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,110
going to go ahead. You'll just hit I on
the factor. Go to maybe 120. Bring it

422
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:46,120
the factor. Go to maybe 120. Bring it
 

423
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,150
the factor. Go to maybe 120. Bring it
over. And then we can

424
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:49,160
over. And then we can
 

425
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,390
over. And then we can
enjoy

426
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:51,400
enjoy
 

427
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,390
enjoy
this. Just like that. And that is how

428
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:54,400
this. Just like that. And that is how
 

429
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,110
this. Just like that. And that is how
you create logos and morph them with

430
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,120
you create logos and morph them with
 

431
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,110
you create logos and morph them with
textures. This is my favorite animation

432
00:07:59,110 --> 00:07:59,120
textures. This is my favorite animation
 

433
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,510
textures. This is my favorite animation
of all of them. yet it's probably one of

434
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:01,520
of all of them. yet it's probably one of
 

435
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,589
of all of them. yet it's probably one of
the most simple ways to execute um this

436
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:05,599
the most simple ways to execute um this
 

437
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,430
the most simple ways to execute um this
idea. So, let me show you how to do it.

438
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:07,440
idea. So, let me show you how to do it.
 

439
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,629
idea. So, let me show you how to do it.
So, just like always, we're going to

440
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:08,639
So, just like always, we're going to
 

441
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,990
So, just like always, we're going to
start with the SVG of our logo. What I'm

442
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,000
start with the SVG of our logo. What I'm
 

443
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,189
start with the SVG of our logo. What I'm
going to do is I'm just going to pull

444
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:13,199
going to do is I'm just going to pull
 

445
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,950
going to do is I'm just going to pull
off uh the geometry and we're just going

446
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:16,960
off uh the geometry and we're just going
 

447
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,550
off uh the geometry and we're just going
to extrude it so we have these nice

448
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:18,560
to extrude it so we have these nice
 

449
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,830
to extrude it so we have these nice
walls. And then I'm going to go ahead

450
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:19,840
walls. And then I'm going to go ahead
 

451
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,469
walls. And then I'm going to go ahead
and get a plane. So, if I go to the very

452
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:22,479
and get a plane. So, if I go to the very
 

453
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,710
and get a plane. So, if I go to the very
top and I hop into cycles, you can see

454
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:24,720
top and I hop into cycles, you can see
 

455
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,550
top and I hop into cycles, you can see
our logo and we'll add a material and

456
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:28,560
our logo and we'll add a material and
 

457
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,110
our logo and we'll add a material and
tell it to be emissive. So, off the bat,

458
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:31,120
tell it to be emissive. So, off the bat,
 

459
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,670
tell it to be emissive. So, off the bat,
we have something pretty cool and very,

460
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:33,680
we have something pretty cool and very,
 

461
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,829
we have something pretty cool and very,
very simple. We can even go ahead and

462
00:08:35,829 --> 00:08:35,839
very simple. We can even go ahead and
 

463
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,389
very simple. We can even go ahead and
add some color to it. But, if I take

464
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:38,399
add some color to it. But, if I take
 

465
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,550
add some color to it. But, if I take
this logo and I duplicate it, we can go

466
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:40,560
this logo and I duplicate it, we can go
 

467
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,070
this logo and I duplicate it, we can go
back into the curve settings and right

468
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:42,080
back into the curve settings and right
 

469
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,389
back into the curve settings and right
here on offset, we can get another one

470
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:44,399
here on offset, we can get another one
 

471
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,470
here on offset, we can get another one
and just bring it in a little bit. So,

472
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:46,480
and just bring it in a little bit. So,
 

473
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,990
and just bring it in a little bit. So,
that's going to allow something really,

474
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,000
that's going to allow something really,
 

475
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,590
that's going to allow something really,
really cool to happen. So if we go back

476
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:49,600
really cool to happen. So if we go back
 

477
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,790
really cool to happen. So if we go back
to the top, I could take this texture.

478
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:52,800
to the top, I could take this texture.
 

479
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,710
to the top, I could take this texture.
We can now just maybe make it black and

480
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:54,720
We can now just maybe make it black and
 

481
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,870
We can now just maybe make it black and
now it limits. Now it's the only the

482
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:56,880
now it limits. Now it's the only the
 

483
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,790
now it limits. Now it's the only the
inner

484
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:57,800
inner
 

485
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,990
inner
texture that is creating emission and

486
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,000
texture that is creating emission and
 

487
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,910
texture that is creating emission and
it's blocking the other one. Or we can

488
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:01,920
it's blocking the other one. Or we can
 

489
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,590
it's blocking the other one. Or we can
do the opposite. We can just bring that

490
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:03,600
do the opposite. We can just bring that
 

491
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,070
do the opposite. We can just bring that
in and now it's just a texture on the

492
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:06,080
in and now it's just a texture on the
 

493
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,310
in and now it's just a texture on the
outside. But here is where we can make

494
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:08,320
outside. But here is where we can make
 

495
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,870
outside. But here is where we can make
it look really, really awesome. And then

496
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:10,880
it look really, really awesome. And then
 

497
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,949
it look really, really awesome. And then
if we head to the shader editor, I'm

498
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:12,959
if we head to the shader editor, I'm
 

499
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,190
if we head to the shader editor, I'm
going to go ahead and put the same

500
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:15,200
going to go ahead and put the same
 

501
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,949
going to go ahead and put the same
material on both of them just to make my

502
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:16,959
material on both of them just to make my
 

503
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,790
material on both of them just to make my
life easy. And let's plug a texture into

504
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:20,800
life easy. And let's plug a texture into
 

505
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,949
life easy. And let's plug a texture into
the emission with a color ramp. So we

506
00:09:22,949 --> 00:09:22,959
the emission with a color ramp. So we
 

507
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,190
the emission with a color ramp. So we
have a noise texture plugged into this.

508
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:25,200
have a noise texture plugged into this.
 

509
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,790
have a noise texture plugged into this.
So now if we make it

510
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:27,800
So now if we make it
 

511
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,310
So now if we make it
4D, you can have a lot of fun with this.

512
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:30,320
4D, you can have a lot of fun with this.
 

513
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,630
4D, you can have a lot of fun with this.
Say bring the detail down, bring the

514
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:32,640
Say bring the detail down, bring the
 

515
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,870
Say bring the detail down, bring the
scale up, and you can do something

516
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:34,880
scale up, and you can do something
 

517
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,470
scale up, and you can do something
really awesome. So say we're going to

518
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:36,480
really awesome. So say we're going to
 

519
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,269
really awesome. So say we're going to
put this over to

520
00:09:38,269 --> 00:09:38,279
put this over to
 

521
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:41,350
put this over to
BPLine. I'm going to add another black

522
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:41,360
BPLine. I'm going to add another black
 

523
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,670
BPLine. I'm going to add another black
just to crunch in the black portions.

524
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:43,680
just to crunch in the black portions.
 

525
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,269
just to crunch in the black portions.
I'm going to make this red.

526
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:47,279
I'm going to make this red.
 

527
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,190
I'm going to make this red.
I'm going to make another one a deep

528
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:50,200
I'm going to make another one a deep
 

529
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,710
I'm going to make another one a deep
blue so that we can just have a nice red

530
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:53,720
blue so that we can just have a nice red
 

531
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,910
blue so that we can just have a nice red
highlight. Then we'll bring the strength

532
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:55,920
highlight. Then we'll bring the strength
 

533
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,829
highlight. Then we'll bring the strength
up pretty good. And so now we

534
00:09:58,829 --> 00:09:58,839
up pretty good. And so now we
 

535
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:00,990
up pretty good. And so now we
have we have

536
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:01,000
have we have
 

537
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,509
have we have
this. But here is the really really cool

538
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:03,519
this. But here is the really really cool
 

539
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,430
this. But here is the really really cool
part. I'm going to go ahead and click on

540
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:05,440
part. I'm going to go ahead and click on
 

541
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,070
part. I'm going to go ahead and click on
the inner

542
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:07,080
the inner
 

543
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,190
the inner
material, duplicate it so it's

544
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:09,200
material, duplicate it so it's
 

545
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,870
material, duplicate it so it's
different, and maybe make the in the

546
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:12,880
different, and maybe make the in the
 

547
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,630
different, and maybe make the in the
maybe make the texture on the inside

548
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:14,640
maybe make the texture on the inside
 

549
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,630
maybe make the texture on the inside
darker and the texture on the outside a

550
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:16,640
darker and the texture on the outside a
 

551
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,430
darker and the texture on the outside a
lot brighter. You can now independently

552
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:20,440
lot brighter. You can now independently
 

553
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,990
lot brighter. You can now independently
control each texture. And you can

554
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,000
control each texture. And you can
 

555
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,829
control each texture. And you can
animate the speeds and the directions of

556
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:25,839
animate the speeds and the directions of
 

557
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,550
animate the speeds and the directions of
those at different speeds, giving them a

558
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:28,560
those at different speeds, giving them a
 

559
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,030
those at different speeds, giving them a
really, really cool look. And because

560
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,040
really, really cool look. And because
 

561
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,829
really, really cool look. And because
it's the logo, it stays to the logo and

562
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:33,839
it's the logo, it stays to the logo and
 

563
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,750
it's the logo, it stays to the logo and
you have something really, really cool

564
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:35,760
you have something really, really cool
 

565
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,910
you have something really, really cool
and honestly very beautiful, especially

566
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:37,920
and honestly very beautiful, especially
 

567
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,509
and honestly very beautiful, especially
with the colors you can pick. You can

568
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:39,519
with the colors you can pick. You can
 

569
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,350
with the colors you can pick. You can
add a glare node. It's incredibly

570
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:41,360
add a glare node. It's incredibly
 

571
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,590
add a glare node. It's incredibly
simple. U but as long as you have access

572
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:43,600
simple. U but as long as you have access
 

573
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,509
simple. U but as long as you have access
to using the text tool or using curves

574
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:45,519
to using the text tool or using curves
 

575
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,990
to using the text tool or using curves
and you can bring in one of those logos.

576
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,000
and you can bring in one of those logos.
 

577
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,990
and you can bring in one of those logos.
It's very simple and it's awesome. So,

578
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:50,000
It's very simple and it's awesome. So,
 

579
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,829
It's very simple and it's awesome. So,
there's a lot of ideas that might lead

580
00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:51,839
there's a lot of ideas that might lead
 

581
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,509
there's a lot of ideas that might lead
you to wanting to fill the inside of

582
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:53,519
you to wanting to fill the inside of
 

583
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,829
you to wanting to fill the inside of
your logo with objects. So, I'm going to

584
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:55,839
your logo with objects. So, I'm going to
 

585
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,590
your logo with objects. So, I'm going to
show you two very similar methods on how

586
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:57,600
show you two very similar methods on how
 

587
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,670
show you two very similar methods on how
to get objects filled. a different

588
00:10:59,670 --> 00:10:59,680
to get objects filled. a different
 

589
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,710
to get objects filled. a different
method that's going to allow you to

590
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:00,720
method that's going to allow you to
 

591
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,389
method that's going to allow you to
animate the objects, but both have their

592
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:02,399
animate the objects, but both have their
 

593
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,990
animate the objects, but both have their
kind of pros and cons. All right, so I

594
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:04,000
kind of pros and cons. All right, so I
 

595
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,750
kind of pros and cons. All right, so I
have my logo. What I'm gonna do is open

596
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:05,760
have my logo. What I'm gonna do is open
 

597
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,670
have my logo. What I'm gonna do is open
up a geometry nodes window. And we are

598
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:07,680
up a geometry nodes window. And we are
 

599
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,829
up a geometry nodes window. And we are
going to be using geometry nodes to

600
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:09,839
going to be using geometry nodes to
 

601
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,350
going to be using geometry nodes to
create this effect. So if we click new,

602
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:11,360
create this effect. So if we click new,
 

603
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,470
create this effect. So if we click new,
you can actually go ahead and convert

604
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:12,480
you can actually go ahead and convert
 

605
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,310
you can actually go ahead and convert
this into a volume like this. And you

606
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:14,320
this into a volume like this. And you
 

607
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,829
this into a volume like this. And you
can bring that voxal amount to kind of

608
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:15,839
can bring that voxal amount to kind of
 

609
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,430
can bring that voxal amount to kind of
smooth it and make it look really nice.

610
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:17,440
smooth it and make it look really nice.
 

611
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,430
smooth it and make it look really nice.
And then we can do a distribute points

612
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:19,440
And then we can do a distribute points
 

613
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,030
And then we can do a distribute points
in volume. And then you can just bring

614
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,040
in volume. And then you can just bring
 

615
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,430
in volume. And then you can just bring
that density up. And now you have the

616
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:23,440
that density up. And now you have the
 

617
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,990
that density up. And now you have the
shape of your logo. You can also just

618
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:26,000
shape of your logo. You can also just
 

619
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,470
shape of your logo. You can also just
use the points themselves as the object

620
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:28,480
use the points themselves as the object
 

621
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,910
use the points themselves as the object
and they will render out as just a round

622
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:31,920
and they will render out as just a round
 

623
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,430
and they will render out as just a round
ball. In this case, this is exactly what

624
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:33,440
ball. In this case, this is exactly what
 

625
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,509
ball. In this case, this is exactly what
I want. Go ahead and actually bring the

626
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:35,519
I want. Go ahead and actually bring the
 

627
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,269
I want. Go ahead and actually bring the
original back with a join geometry. And

628
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:39,279
original back with a join geometry. And
 

629
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,430
original back with a join geometry. And
then we can add materials to this so we

630
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:41,440
then we can add materials to this so we
 

631
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,030
then we can add materials to this so we
can actually appreciate it. So I'll just

632
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,040
can actually appreciate it. So I'll just
 

633
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,430
can actually appreciate it. So I'll just
add a

634
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:44,440
add a
 

635
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,590
add a
material. Make it

636
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:46,600
material. Make it
 

637
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,269
material. Make it
glass. And you can now see the inside of

638
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:49,279
glass. And you can now see the inside of
 

639
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,269
glass. And you can now see the inside of
your scene. And just bring up that

640
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:51,279
your scene. And just bring up that
 

641
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,110
your scene. And just bring up that
density a whole bunch. And now you have

642
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,120
density a whole bunch. And now you have
 

643
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,269
density a whole bunch. And now you have
your logo. The problem is if I want to

644
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:55,279
your logo. The problem is if I want to
 

645
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,269
your logo. The problem is if I want to
make these objects move around, they are

646
00:11:57,269 --> 00:11:57,279
make these objects move around, they are
 

647
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,389
make these objects move around, they are
going to be shooting. I mean, you can

648
00:11:58,389 --> 00:11:58,399
going to be shooting. I mean, you can
 

649
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,710
going to be shooting. I mean, you can
already see some of them are coming out.

650
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:00,720
already see some of them are coming out.
 

651
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,630
already see some of them are coming out.
And that's just going to be editing your

652
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:02,640
And that's just going to be editing your
 

653
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,829
And that's just going to be editing your
seed value to make sure they're all

654
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:03,839
seed value to make sure they're all
 

655
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,150
seed value to make sure they're all
inside of it. But if I want to actually

656
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:06,160
inside of it. But if I want to actually
 

657
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,350
inside of it. But if I want to actually
animate this, I can't. It's too They're

658
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:09,360
animate this, I can't. It's too They're
 

659
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,190
animate this, I can't. It's too They're
too close to the edge already. So, let

660
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:11,200
too close to the edge already. So, let
 

661
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,750
too close to the edge already. So, let
me show you something you can do

662
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:13,760
me show you something you can do
 

663
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,430
me show you something you can do
instead. I'm going to kill this node

664
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:15,440
instead. I'm going to kill this node
 

665
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,190
instead. I'm going to kill this node
tree. And what we'll do, so what I can

666
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:17,200
tree. And what we'll do, so what I can
 

667
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,910
tree. And what we'll do, so what I can
do is I can duplicate my logo. And then

668
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:19,920
do is I can duplicate my logo. And then
 

669
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,150
do is I can duplicate my logo. And then
I'm going to take the original one and

670
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:22,160
I'm going to take the original one and
 

671
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,670
I'm going to take the original one and
in the curve settings right here, you

672
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:23,680
in the curve settings right here, you
 

673
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,230
in the curve settings right here, you
can just bring that offset in just like

674
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:26,240
can just bring that offset in just like
 

675
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,870
can just bring that offset in just like
this. And also bring that extrude in. So

676
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:28,880
this. And also bring that extrude in. So
 

677
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,629
this. And also bring that extrude in. So
you now have a smaller, skinnier version

678
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:32,639
you now have a smaller, skinnier version
 

679
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,110
you now have a smaller, skinnier version
of the logo. We can go back to geometry

680
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:35,120
of the logo. We can go back to geometry
 

681
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,590
of the logo. We can go back to geometry
nodes. And if I pull that old node tree

682
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:37,600
nodes. And if I pull that old node tree
 

683
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,590
nodes. And if I pull that old node tree
back and delete the original. So now we

684
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:39,600
back and delete the original. So now we
 

685
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,069
back and delete the original. So now we
have a bunch of objects that we can then

686
00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:42,079
have a bunch of objects that we can then
 

687
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,949
have a bunch of objects that we can then
if we get a set position and animate

688
00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:44,959
if we get a set position and animate
 

689
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,190
if we get a set position and animate
these with a noise texture. We can now

690
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:47,200
these with a noise texture. We can now
 

691
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,790
these with a noise texture. We can now
take these guys and you can do

692
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:49,800
take these guys and you can do
 

693
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,990
take these guys and you can do
this with the original geometry. So now

694
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:54,000
this with the original geometry. So now
 

695
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,829
this with the original geometry. So now
you can actually take these particles,

696
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:55,839
you can actually take these particles,
 

697
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,990
you can actually take these particles,
bring them up a little bit and actually

698
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:58,000
bring them up a little bit and actually
 

699
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,470
bring them up a little bit and actually
animate objects inside of your logo. So

700
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:02,480
animate objects inside of your logo. So
 

701
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,030
animate objects inside of your logo. So
both of these methods do populate the

702
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:05,040
both of these methods do populate the
 

703
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,269
both of these methods do populate the
inside. though it's just not going to

704
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:07,279
inside. though it's just not going to
 

705
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,190
inside. though it's just not going to
feel full. But that is how the two

706
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:09,200
feel full. But that is how the two
 

707
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,150
feel full. But that is how the two
methods of populating the inside of a

708
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,160
methods of populating the inside of a
 

709
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,790
methods of populating the inside of a
logo. Staying on the geometry nodes

710
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:14,800
logo. Staying on the geometry nodes
 

711
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,430
logo. Staying on the geometry nodes
topic, you can actually use masks to

712
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:17,440
topic, you can actually use masks to
 

713
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,230
topic, you can actually use masks to
delete objects. You can use masks to

714
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:20,240
delete objects. You can use masks to
 

715
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,710
delete objects. You can use masks to
control geometry within geometry nodes

716
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:22,720
control geometry within geometry nodes
 

717
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,710
control geometry within geometry nodes
to have some really really cool options

718
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:24,720
to have some really really cool options
 

719
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,190
to have some really really cool options
with making interesting things using

720
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:27,200
with making interesting things using
 

721
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,350
with making interesting things using
masks, creating geometry in geometry

722
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:29,360
masks, creating geometry in geometry
 

723
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,030
masks, creating geometry in geometry
nodes. It's very, very powerful. Just

724
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:31,040
nodes. It's very, very powerful. Just
 

725
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,150
nodes. It's very, very powerful. Just
like earlier in the video, we are going

726
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:32,160
like earlier in the video, we are going
 

727
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,590
like earlier in the video, we are going
to need a black and white version of our

728
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:35,600
to need a black and white version of our
 

729
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,910
to need a black and white version of our
logo. I'm just going to start with a

730
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:37,920
logo. I'm just going to start with a
 

731
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,430
logo. I'm just going to start with a
grid in geometry nodes. I'm going to

732
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:39,440
grid in geometry nodes. I'm going to
 

733
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,910
grid in geometry nodes. I'm going to
scale it up and give it subdivisions of

734
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:41,920
scale it up and give it subdivisions of
 

735
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,829
scale it up and give it subdivisions of
80. The biggest obstacle to making this

736
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:43,839
80. The biggest obstacle to making this
 

737
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,870
80. The biggest obstacle to making this
work is mapping the logo properly. So,

738
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:46,880
work is mapping the logo properly. So,
 

739
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,990
work is mapping the logo properly. So,
let me show you how to do that. We're

740
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:48,000
let me show you how to do that. We're
 

741
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,350
let me show you how to do that. We're
going to do a we're going to go ahead

742
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:49,360
going to do a we're going to go ahead
 

743
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,910
going to do a we're going to go ahead
and convert this over to just regular

744
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:51,920
and convert this over to just regular
 

745
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,590
and convert this over to just regular
points so we can actually see the logo.

746
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:53,600
points so we can actually see the logo.
 

747
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,030
points so we can actually see the logo.
And then if you get a delete geometry,

748
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,040
And then if you get a delete geometry,
 

749
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,150
And then if you get a delete geometry,
that's going to say, "Hey, delete

750
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:56,160
that's going to say, "Hey, delete
 

751
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,430
that's going to say, "Hey, delete
points." We're going to go ahead and

752
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:58,440
points." We're going to go ahead and
 

753
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,910
points." We're going to go ahead and
throw an image texture right onto this

754
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:01,920
throw an image texture right onto this
 

755
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,910
throw an image texture right onto this
and grab our logo. So, we're going to

756
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:03,920
and grab our logo. So, we're going to
 

757
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,590
and grab our logo. So, we're going to
use the Blender logo. And you can see

758
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:05,600
use the Blender logo. And you can see
 

759
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,750
use the Blender logo. And you can see
some type of tiling is happening here.

760
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:07,760
some type of tiling is happening here.
 

761
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,350
some type of tiling is happening here.
So, we're going to go here from repeat

762
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:09,360
So, we're going to go here from repeat
 

763
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,990
So, we're going to go here from repeat
to clip. I only want one logo. And

764
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,000
to clip. I only want one logo. And
 

765
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,470
to clip. I only want one logo. And
typically, we'd want a mapping node. We

766
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:14,480
typically, we'd want a mapping node. We
 

767
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,829
typically, we'd want a mapping node. We
can't do that. We don't have a mapping

768
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:15,839
can't do that. We don't have a mapping
 

769
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,069
can't do that. We don't have a mapping
node, geometry nodes, but a mapping node

770
00:14:18,069 --> 00:14:18,079
node, geometry nodes, but a mapping node
 

771
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,629
node, geometry nodes, but a mapping node
is just vector math. So, if we plug in a

772
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:20,639
is just vector math. So, if we plug in a
 

773
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,389
is just vector math. So, if we plug in a
position and add, you can see, okay, now

774
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:22,399
position and add, you can see, okay, now
 

775
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,189
position and add, you can see, okay, now
we can put this logo wherever we want.

776
00:14:25,189 --> 00:14:25,199
we can put this logo wherever we want.
 

777
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,269
we can put this logo wherever we want.
And then a scale node is just going to

778
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:27,279
And then a scale node is just going to
 

779
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,150
And then a scale node is just going to
keep that logo exactly how we want it.

780
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:30,160
keep that logo exactly how we want it.
 

781
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,750
keep that logo exactly how we want it.
It's not going to stretch or squash it.

782
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:31,760
It's not going to stretch or squash it.
 

783
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,110
It's not going to stretch or squash it.
It's going to respect uh where it, you

784
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:35,120
It's going to respect uh where it, you
 

785
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,910
It's going to respect uh where it, you
know, how it wants to to look. So now we

786
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:37,920
know, how it wants to to look. So now we
 

787
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,829
know, how it wants to to look. So now we
have this. And then we can just go ahead

788
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:39,839
have this. And then we can just go ahead
 

789
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,310
have this. And then we can just go ahead
and invert this. Now we have a logo made

790
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:44,320
and invert this. Now we have a logo made
 

791
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,310
and invert this. Now we have a logo made
of points, which is awesome. Now we

792
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:46,320
of points, which is awesome. Now we
 

793
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,230
of points, which is awesome. Now we
could do whatever we want here. We could

794
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:48,240
could do whatever we want here. We could
 

795
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,030
could do whatever we want here. We could
go ahead and just instance a cube on

796
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:51,040
go ahead and just instance a cube on
 

797
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,710
go ahead and just instance a cube on
every single one of these points that we

798
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:52,720
every single one of these points that we
 

799
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,629
every single one of these points that we
have. Then you can use a noise texture

800
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:54,639
have. Then you can use a noise texture
 

801
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,509
have. Then you can use a noise texture
to actually animate the scale which can

802
00:14:57,509 --> 00:14:57,519
to actually animate the scale which can
 

803
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,509
to actually animate the scale which can
look really really cool. And then now

804
00:14:59,509 --> 00:14:59,519
look really really cool. And then now
 

805
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,509
look really really cool. And then now
you have something really really awesome

806
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:01,519
you have something really really awesome
 

807
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,189
you have something really really awesome
like pretty quick and you can use any

808
00:15:03,189 --> 00:15:03,199
like pretty quick and you can use any
 

809
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,189
like pretty quick and you can use any
object you want. But now we're at the

810
00:15:05,189 --> 00:15:05,199
object you want. But now we're at the
 

811
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,350
object you want. But now we're at the
shape of the logo. So you can so you

812
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:07,360
shape of the logo. So you can so you
 

813
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,870
shape of the logo. So you can so you
have a lot of data. So if you are

814
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:08,880
have a lot of data. So if you are
 

815
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,949
have a lot of data. So if you are
familiar with geometry nodes taking this

816
00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:10,959
familiar with geometry nodes taking this
 

817
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,710
familiar with geometry nodes taking this
mapping a logo doing something really

818
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:12,720
mapping a logo doing something really
 

819
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,509
mapping a logo doing something really
cool on Patreon I was able to take this

820
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:15,519
cool on Patreon I was able to take this
 

821
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,829
cool on Patreon I was able to take this
add a sur add some surrounding objects

822

texture added a procedural wood material

826
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:21,839
texture added a procedural wood material
 

827
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,750
texture added a procedural wood material
to it. So the creative application to

828
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:23,760
to it. So the creative application to
 

829
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,350
to it. So the creative application to
just a little bit of this data in

830
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:25,360
just a little bit of this data in
 

831
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,550
just a little bit of this data in
geometry nodes, especially if you're

832
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:26,560
geometry nodes, especially if you're
 

833
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,550
geometry nodes, especially if you're
familiar with geometry nodes, can really

834
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:28,560
familiar with geometry nodes, can really
 

835
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,230
familiar with geometry nodes, can really
yield some really awesome things.

836
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:30,240
yield some really awesome things.
 

837
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,590
yield some really awesome things.
Another really cool thing could just be

838
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:31,600
Another really cool thing could just be
 

839
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,269
Another really cool thing could just be
getting like a curved circle and then

840
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:33,279
getting like a curved circle and then
 

841
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,430
getting like a curved circle and then
randomizing some of these objects. You

842
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:35,440
randomizing some of these objects. You
 

843
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,590
randomizing some of these objects. You
can do another delete geometry and just

844
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:37,600
can do another delete geometry and just
 

845
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,230
can do another delete geometry and just
do a random value boolean and then you

846
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:40,240
do a random value boolean and then you
 

847
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,389
do a random value boolean and then you
can just have maybe like some of these

848
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:42,399
can just have maybe like some of these
 

849
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,670
can just have maybe like some of these
disappearing to give you more of an

850
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:43,680
disappearing to give you more of an
 

851
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,350
disappearing to give you more of an
organic look. So now some of these

852
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:45,360
organic look. So now some of these
 

853
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,350
organic look. So now some of these
objects are missing and you can even use

854
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:47,360
objects are missing and you can even use
 

855
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,710
objects are missing and you can even use
a noise texture too if you want to

856
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:48,720
a noise texture too if you want to
 

857
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,030
a noise texture too if you want to
animate this look. So there's a lot of

858
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:51,040
animate this look. So there's a lot of
 

859
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,430
animate this look. So there's a lot of
really really effective uses of this

860
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:54,440
really really effective uses of this
 

861
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:58,310
really really effective uses of this
idea in geometry nodes, but having this

862
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:58,320
idea in geometry nodes, but having this
 

863
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,949
idea in geometry nodes, but having this
image texture really cool. Last thing

864
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:00,959
image texture really cool. Last thing
 

865
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,230
image texture really cool. Last thing
I'm going to show you is how to get a

866
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:02,240
I'm going to show you is how to get a
 

867
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,310
I'm going to show you is how to get a
logo very quickly to look like this

868
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:04,320
logo very quickly to look like this
 

869
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,829
logo very quickly to look like this
little furball. We're not going to go

870
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:05,839
little furball. We're not going to go
 

871
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,269
little furball. We're not going to go
really really in depth with this. If you

872
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:07,279
really really in depth with this. If you
 

873
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,629
really really in depth with this. If you
want to get in depth with this exact

874
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:08,639
want to get in depth with this exact
 

875
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,310
want to get in depth with this exact
process, Southern Shotty has an awesome

876
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:10,320
process, Southern Shotty has an awesome
 

877
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,829
process, Southern Shotty has an awesome
video that I highly recommend if you

878
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:11,839
video that I highly recommend if you
 

879
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,189
video that I highly recommend if you
want to really get into this. But I'm

880
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:13,199
want to really get into this. But I'm
 

881
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,389
want to really get into this. But I'm
going to show you the bones of how to

882
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:14,399
going to show you the bones of how to
 

883
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,509
going to show you the bones of how to
get some fur super fast. So I remshed

884
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:17,519
get some fur super fast. So I remshed
 

885
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,269
get some fur super fast. So I remshed
and smoothed the logo. I do want it to

886
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:19,279
and smoothed the logo. I do want it to
 

887
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,189
and smoothed the logo. I do want it to
be kind of nice and round looking like

888
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:21,199
be kind of nice and round looking like
 

889
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,470
be kind of nice and round looking like
something like this. And then I'm just

890
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:22,480
something like this. And then I'm just
 

891
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,030
something like this. And then I'm just
going to go convert it to a mesh. Now,

892
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,040
going to go convert it to a mesh. Now,
 

893
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,230
going to go convert it to a mesh. Now,
for this you need UVs. This actually

894
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:28,240
for this you need UVs. This actually
 

895
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,870
for this you need UVs. This actually
works quite well, but if you just hit U

896
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:30,880
works quite well, but if you just hit U
 

897
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,069
works quite well, but if you just hit U
and do a smart UV project and click

898
00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:34,079
and do a smart UV project and click
 

899
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,509
and do a smart UV project and click
unwrap, you can actually see like not

900
00:16:37,509 --> 00:16:37,519
unwrap, you can actually see like not
 

901
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,829
unwrap, you can actually see like not
bad in in this in this context. It

902
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:39,839
bad in in this in this context. It
 

903
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,670
bad in in this in this context. It
actually works very well. It's certainly

904
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:41,680
actually works very well. It's certainly
 

905
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,269
actually works very well. It's certainly
not perfect, but it works really well.

906
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:43,279
not perfect, but it works really well.
 

907
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,310
not perfect, but it works really well.
here. What we'll do is I'll just hit F3

908
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:46,320
here. What we'll do is I'll just hit F3
 

909
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,110
here. What we'll do is I'll just hit F3
and click on a quick fur. So now we have

910
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:49,120
and click on a quick fur. So now we have
 

911
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,069
and click on a quick fur. So now we have
this. If I go here to cycles, we we have

912
00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:52,079
this. If I go here to cycles, we we have
 

913
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,310
this. If I go here to cycles, we we have
fur. So it's going to open up a bunch of

914
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:54,320
fur. So it's going to open up a bunch of
 

915
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,189
fur. So it's going to open up a bunch of
these modifiers. Really simply, this top

916
00:16:57,189 --> 00:16:57,199
these modifiers. Really simply, this top
 

917
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,910
these modifiers. Really simply, this top
modifier is just going to control the

918
00:16:59,910 --> 00:16:59,920
modifier is just going to control the
 

919
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,910
modifier is just going to control the
way that the individual hair looks in

920
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:01,920
way that the individual hair looks in
 

921
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,309
way that the individual hair looks in
terms of how big it is. You have your

922
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:04,319
terms of how big it is. You have your
 

923
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,909
terms of how big it is. You have your
shape, which is going to kind of play

924
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:05,919
shape, which is going to kind of play
 

925
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,590
shape, which is going to kind of play
with, oh, where is sort of the

926
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:07,600
with, oh, where is sort of the
 

927
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,669
with, oh, where is sort of the
skinniness. So it inverts it like that.

928
00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:09,679
skinniness. So it inverts it like that.
 

929
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,590
skinniness. So it inverts it like that.
is I'm have a radius of

930
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:12,600
is I'm have a radius of
 

931
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,309
is I'm have a radius of
03. I want kind of a thicker guy. And

932
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:16,319
03. I want kind of a thicker guy. And
 

933
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,829
03. I want kind of a thicker guy. And
then maybe my max brings this down a

934
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:17,839
then maybe my max brings this down a
 

935
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,270
then maybe my max brings this down a
little bit, but honestly, we'll keep it

936
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:20,280
little bit, but honestly, we'll keep it
 

937
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,710
little bit, but honestly, we'll keep it
here. Maybe bring my max down a little

938
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:22,720
here. Maybe bring my max down a little
 

939
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,309
here. Maybe bring my max down a little
bit. This next modifier is going to

940
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:25,319
bit. This next modifier is going to
 

941
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,909
bit. This next modifier is going to
control how many hairs are going to show

942
00:17:27,909 --> 00:17:27,919
control how many hairs are going to show
 

943
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,070
control how many hairs are going to show
up in your render and your viewport. So,

944
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:30,080
up in your render and your viewport. So,
 

945
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,909
up in your render and your viewport. So,
we have density here. So, what I'm going

946
00:17:31,909 --> 00:17:31,919
we have density here. So, what I'm going
 

947
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,110
we have density here. So, what I'm going
to do is I'm going to do my viewport

948
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:33,120
to do is I'm going to do my viewport
 

949
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,909
to do is I'm going to do my viewport
amount of like 0.005

950
00:17:34,909 --> 00:17:34,919
amount of like 0.005
 

951
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:37,430
amount of like 0.005
000 five and then I'm going to do a

952
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:37,440
000 five and then I'm going to do a
 

953
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,430
000 five and then I'm going to do a
density of I'm going to do like 80,000.

954
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:41,440
density of I'm going to do like 80,000.
 

955
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,350
density of I'm going to do like 80,000.
So now you'll notice in the render it's

956
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:43,360
So now you'll notice in the render it's
 

957
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,669
So now you'll notice in the render it's
full big hairy guy but this is the

958
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:45,679
full big hairy guy but this is the
 

959
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,750
full big hairy guy but this is the
viewport. So this allows you to look at

960
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:47,760
viewport. So this allows you to look at
 

961
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,029
viewport. So this allows you to look at
your edits in real time but already

962
00:17:50,029 --> 00:17:50,039
your edits in real time but already
 

963
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:52,390
your edits in real time but already
immediately this looks awesome. This

964
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:52,400
immediately this looks awesome. This
 

965
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,710
immediately this looks awesome. This
next one plays with the overall noise

966
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:54,720
next one plays with the overall noise
 

967
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,549
next one plays with the overall noise
pattern that creates those waves and

968
00:17:56,549 --> 00:17:56,559
pattern that creates those waves and
 

969
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,470
pattern that creates those waves and
shapes that you can see in this render.

970
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:58,480
shapes that you can see in this render.
 

971
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,630
shapes that you can see in this render.
You can see that it's a noise texture.

972
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:00,640
You can see that it's a noise texture.
 

973
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,630
You can see that it's a noise texture.
This next one, the frizz actually edits

974
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:03,640
This next one, the frizz actually edits
 

975
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,909
This next one, the frizz actually edits
the kind of a noise pattern on the

976
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:05,919
the kind of a noise pattern on the
 

977
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,070
the kind of a noise pattern on the
individual hair rather than the full

978
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,080
individual hair rather than the full
 

979
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,310
individual hair rather than the full
each individual hair. So I play with So

980
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:10,320
each individual hair. So I play with So
 

981
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,029
each individual hair. So I play with So
if I play with the shape on these hairs,

982
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:13,039
if I play with the shape on these hairs,
 

983
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,630
if I play with the shape on these hairs,
you'll notice it kind of straightens

984
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:14,640
you'll notice it kind of straightens
 

985
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,150
you'll notice it kind of straightens
them out. If I bring them down, it

986
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:16,160
them out. If I bring them down, it
 

987
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,029
them out. If I bring them down, it
frizzes them a little bit more. So I'm

988
00:18:19,029 --> 00:18:19,039
frizzes them a little bit more. So I'm
 

989
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,390
frizzes them a little bit more. So I'm
going to play with the distance on the

990
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:20,400
going to play with the distance on the
 

991
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,110
going to play with the distance on the
frizz and make it

992
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:22,120
frizz and make it
 

993
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,390
frizz and make it
really kind of tangly, but it

994
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:25,400
really kind of tangly, but it
 

995
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,310
really kind of tangly, but it
also makes them bigger. And so now we

996
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:28,320
also makes them bigger. And so now we
 

997
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,230
also makes them bigger. And so now we
can head into the curve presets that

998
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:32,240
can head into the curve presets that
 

999
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,190
can head into the curve presets that
Blender very recently added. So if we go

1000
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:35,200
Blender very recently added. So if we go
 

1001
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,590
Blender very recently added. So if we go
here to the asset browser, I'm going to

1002
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:37,600
here to the asset browser, I'm going to
 

1003
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,630
here to the asset browser, I'm going to
go to the very

1004
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:39,640
go to the very
 

1005
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,390
go to the very
bottom and I'm going to want to get a

1006
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:42,400
bottom and I'm going to want to get a
 

1007
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,789
bottom and I'm going to want to get a
trim hair curves modifier. And what

1008
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:44,799
trim hair curves modifier. And what
 

1009
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:48,390
trim hair curves modifier. And what
that's going to do is trim the length

1010
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:48,400
that's going to do is trim the length
 

1011
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,789
that's going to do is trim the length
based on all those edits. And then what

1012
00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:50,799
based on all those edits. And then what
 

1013
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,630
based on all those edits. And then what
I don't want is it to look like I took a

1014
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:52,640
I don't want is it to look like I took a
 

1015
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,110
I don't want is it to look like I took a
razor and just raise razored the top.

1016
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,120
razor and just raise razored the top.
 

1017
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,270
razor and just raise razored the top.
So, I'm going to get them the max length

1018
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:57,280
So, I'm going to get them the max length
 

1019
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,350
So, I'm going to get them the max length
I want them here. And then the random

1020
00:18:59,350 --> 00:18:59,360
I want them here. And then the random
 

1021
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,190
I want them here. And then the random
offset will bring a couple of them down.

1022
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:01,200
offset will bring a couple of them down.
 

1023
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,230
offset will bring a couple of them down.
So, now it's a bit of a random look. And

1024
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:04,240
So, now it's a bit of a random look. And
 

1025
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,710
So, now it's a bit of a random look. And
this is what we have so far. Very

1026
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:06,720
this is what we have so far. Very
 

1027
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,470
this is what we have so far. Very
quickly, it looks really good. Of

1028
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:08,480
quickly, it looks really good. Of
 

1029
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,710
quickly, it looks really good. Of
course, if you want a little bit if you

1030
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:10,720
course, if you want a little bit if you
 

1031
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,950
course, if you want a little bit if you
want control over the material, we do

1032
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:12,960
want control over the material, we do
 

1033
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,510
want control over the material, we do
have a fur material right here. So, what

1034
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:15,520
have a fur material right here. So, what
 

1035
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,110
have a fur material right here. So, what
I would do is just go ahead and add that

1036
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:17,120
I would do is just go ahead and add that
 

1037
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,350
I would do is just go ahead and add that
fur material also to the base. That says

1038
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:19,360
fur material also to the base. That says
 

1039
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,190
fur material also to the base. That says
curve. That's our logo. We'll click back

1040
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:21,200
curve. That's our logo. We'll click back
 

1041
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,510
curve. That's our logo. We'll click back
on curves. And then we can just switch

1042
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:23,520
on curves. And then we can just switch
 

1043
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,750
on curves. And then we can just switch
this guy over to the shader editor. Make

1044
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:25,760
this guy over to the shader editor. Make
 

1045
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,070
this guy over to the shader editor. Make
sure you click use nodes. And you'll now

1046
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:28,080
sure you click use nodes. And you'll now
 

1047
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,789
sure you click use nodes. And you'll now
have access to adding materials to this.

1048
00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:30,799
have access to adding materials to this.
 

1049
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,230
have access to adding materials to this.
So I'm going to make it really rough.

1050
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:32,240
So I'm going to make it really rough.
 

1051
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,270
So I'm going to make it really rough.
You can plug a noise texture into this

1052
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:35,280
You can plug a noise texture into this
 

1053
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,590
You can plug a noise texture into this
whole system like that. Let's see how

1054
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:37,600
whole system like that. Let's see how
 

1055
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,110
whole system like that. Let's see how
this looks in a final and we'll be

1056
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:39,120
this looks in a final and we'll be
 

1057
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,190
this looks in a final and we'll be
completely done. And here we have it. A

1058
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:41,200
completely done. And here we have it. A
 

1059
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,630
completely done. And here we have it. A
very quick furry logo. I showed you

1060
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:44,640
very quick furry logo. I showed you
 

1061
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,549
very quick furry logo. I showed you
about 10% of the controls here. There's

1062
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:46,559
about 10% of the controls here. There's
 

1063
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,230
about 10% of the controls here. There's
a lot more you can do with this, but I

1064
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:48,240
a lot more you can do with this, but I
 

1065
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,430
a lot more you can do with this, but I
wanted to show you the quickest way to

1066
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:49,440
wanted to show you the quickest way to
 

1067
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,029
wanted to show you the quickest way to
make it just look really nice and really

1068
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:51,039
make it just look really nice and really
 

1069
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,430
make it just look really nice and really
cool for ideiation reasons. And you can

1070
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:53,440
cool for ideiation reasons. And you can
 

1071
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,549
cool for ideiation reasons. And you can
check out that video from Southern

1072
00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:54,559
check out that video from Southern
 

1073
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,350
check out that video from Southern
Shoddy uh to really take this further.

1074
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:57,360

So, there you guys go. That is six

1076
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:58,720
So, there you guys go. That is six
 

1077
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,710
So, there you guys go. That is six
concepts that you can do kind of

1078
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:00,720
concepts that you can do kind of
 

1079
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,710
concepts that you can do kind of
hundreds of things with just those base

1080
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:02,720
hundreds of things with just those base
 

1081
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,110
hundreds of things with just those base
ideas on how to change logos. Of course,

1082
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:05,120
ideas on how to change logos. Of course,
 

1083
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,750
ideas on how to change logos. Of course,
logo and Blender just means geometry in

1084
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:07,760
logo and Blender just means geometry in
 

1085
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,270
logo and Blender just means geometry in
the shape of a logo. So, that's kind of
