00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,990

How's it going? So, in this tutorial, we

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:02,000
How's it going? So, in this tutorial, we
 

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,990
How's it going? So, in this tutorial, we
are going to be making this animation

4
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:04,000
are going to be making this animation
 

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,190
are going to be making this animation
right here. We're first going to be

6
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:05,200
right here. We're first going to be
 

7
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,110
right here. We're first going to be
taking a black and white image and we're

8
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:07,120
taking a black and white image and we're
 

9
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,870
taking a black and white image and we're
going to be using that as the way to

10
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:08,880
going to be using that as the way to
 

11
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,350
going to be using that as the way to
create the text in our animation. First,

12
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:11,360
create the text in our animation. First,
 

13
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,950
create the text in our animation. First,
we're going to take a grid and duplicate

14
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:12,960
we're going to take a grid and duplicate
 

15
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,950
we're going to take a grid and duplicate
points within that grid. Then, use that

16
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:14,960
points within that grid. Then, use that
 

17
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,510
points within that grid. Then, use that
image as the way to delete the points

18
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:17,520
image as the way to delete the points
 

19
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,230
image as the way to delete the points
when they are in the space of the text.

20
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:20,240
when they are in the space of the text.
 

21
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,590
when they are in the space of the text.
After that, we'll do some simple

22
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:21,600
After that, we'll do some simple
 

23
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,509
After that, we'll do some simple
displacement to animate all of those

24
00:00:23,509 --> 00:00:23,519
displacement to animate all of those
 

25
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,670
displacement to animate all of those
points and use that same displacement to

26
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:25,680
points and use that same displacement to
 

27
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,750
points and use that same displacement to
provide color within those points. Then

28
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:27,760
provide color within those points. Then
 

29
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,589
provide color within those points. Then
we just need some simple lighting.

30
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:29,599
we just need some simple lighting.
 

31
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,990
we just need some simple lighting.
Animate the movement with a loop and

32
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:32,000
Animate the movement with a loop and
 

33
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,750
Animate the movement with a loop and
we'll be done. If you want to learn more

34
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:33,760
we'll be done. If you want to learn more
 

35
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,350
we'll be done. If you want to learn more
about particle systems and how to make

36
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:35,360
about particle systems and how to make
 

37
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,670
about particle systems and how to make
them look cooler, light them, animate

38
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:37,680
them look cooler, light them, animate
 

39
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,910
them look cooler, light them, animate
them, a lot of different ways to control

40
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:39,920
them, a lot of different ways to control
 

41

are going to be using this image as the
 

63
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,470
are going to be using this image as the
mask in our animation. If you don't have

64
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:02,480
mask in our animation. If you don't have
 

65
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,990
mask in our animation. If you don't have
your own black and white image, you can

66
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:04,000
your own black and white image, you can
 

67
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,310
your own black and white image, you can
quite literally use any black and white

68
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:06,320

again, use any black and white image as

82
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:18,240
again, use any black and white image as
 

83
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,749
again, use any black and white image as
your mask and it does not need to be

84
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:19,759
your mask and it does not need to be
 

85
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,789
your mask and it does not need to be
this aspect ratio. So, just have some

86
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:22,799
this aspect ratio. So, just have some
 

87
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,030
this aspect ratio. So, just have some
type of mask image that you want to use

88
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:25,040
type of mask image that you want to use
 

89
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,350
type of mask image that you want to use
as the shape within your particle

90
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:27,360
as the shape within your particle
 

91
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,190
as the shape within your particle
system. Now, let's go ahead here in

92
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:29,200
system. Now, let's go ahead here in
 

93
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,550
system. Now, let's go ahead here in
Blender. I'm going to open up a brand

94
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:30,560
Blender. I'm going to open up a brand
 

95
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,469
Blender. I'm going to open up a brand
new window. I'm going go ahead and get a

96
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:32,479
new window. I'm going go ahead and get a
 

97
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,190
new window. I'm going go ahead and get a
plane. And up here, we're going to get a

98
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:35,200
plane. And up here, we're going to get a
 

99
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,990
plane. And up here, we're going to get a
geometry nodes editor and click new. So,

100
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:38,000
geometry nodes editor and click new. So,
 

101
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,910
geometry nodes editor and click new. So,
first let's go ahead and get a cube. So,

102
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:41,920
first let's go ahead and get a cube. So,
 

103
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,830
first let's go ahead and get a cube. So,
we'll go ahead cube be cube. Plug him

104
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:45,840
we'll go ahead cube be cube. Plug him
 

105
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,830
we'll go ahead cube be cube. Plug him
here. And let's go ahead and stretch him

106
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:47,840
here. And let's go ahead and stretch him
 

107
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,030
here. And let's go ahead and stretch him
to be uh to fill the space that we want

108
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,040
to be uh to fill the space that we want
 

109
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,670
to be uh to fill the space that we want
to have our text occupy. Something

110
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:53,680
to have our text occupy. Something
 

111
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,350
to have our text occupy. Something
around these lines. It really does not

112
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:55,360
around these lines. It really does not
 

113
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,510
around these lines. It really does not
need to be exact. And just about how

114
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:57,520
need to be exact. And just about how
 

115
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,190
need to be exact. And just about how
thick you want those particles to be as

116
00:01:59,190 --> 00:01:59,200
thick you want those particles to be as
 

117
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,550
thick you want those particles to be as
well. Something like this. Now, what we

118
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:00,560
well. Something like this. Now, what we
 

119
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,030
well. Something like this. Now, what we
can do is convert this thing to a

120
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:03,040
can do is convert this thing to a
 

121
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,030
can do is convert this thing to a
volume. So, mesh to volume,

122
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,040
volume. So, mesh to volume,
 

123
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,389
volume. So, mesh to volume,
just like that. And then you can bring

124
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:08,399
just like that. And then you can bring
 

125
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,309
just like that. And then you can bring
up that density. You can bring up that

126
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:10,319
up that density. You can bring up that
 

127
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,390
up that density. You can bring up that
voxil amount. H, which is really isn't

128
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:12,400
voxil amount. H, which is really isn't
 

129
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,589
voxil amount. H, which is really isn't
that important. And then you can bring

130
00:02:13,589 --> 00:02:13,599
that important. And then you can bring
 

131
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,830
that important. And then you can bring
up that density to make sure that the

132
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:15,840
up that density to make sure that the
 

133
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,030
up that density to make sure that the
volume is the same size as our cube. Now

134
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:19,040
volume is the same size as our cube. Now
 

135
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,430
volume is the same size as our cube. Now
what we can do is do a distribute points

136
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:21,440
what we can do is do a distribute points
 

137
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,869
what we can do is do a distribute points
in volume. So distribute points in

138
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:24,879
in volume. So distribute points in
 

139
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,470
in volume. So distribute points in
volume node. And then you could start to

140
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:26,480
volume node. And then you could start to
 

141
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,790
volume node. And then you could start to
bring up that density pretty quick. And

142
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:28,800
bring up that density pretty quick. And
 

143
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,550
bring up that density pretty quick. And
now we have a field of randomly placed

144
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:32,560
now we have a field of randomly placed
 

145
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,550
now we have a field of randomly placed
uh particles. So what I want to do now

146
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:34,560
uh particles. So what I want to do now
 

147
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,790
uh particles. So what I want to do now
is I'm hit shift A and get a plane. And

148
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:36,800
is I'm hit shift A and get a plane. And
 

149
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,670
is I'm hit shift A and get a plane. And
I just want this plane uh to be the

150
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:39,680
I just want this plane uh to be the
 

151
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,030
I just want this plane uh to be the
floor that is going to we can see uh

152
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,040
floor that is going to we can see uh
 

153
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,710
floor that is going to we can see uh
through the text. And so we can just

154
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:44,720
through the text. And so we can just
 

155
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,270
through the text. And so we can just
bring that grid

156
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:47,280
bring that grid
 

157
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,390
bring that grid
right at the very bottom of the

158
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:48,400
right at the very bottom of the
 

159
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,790
right at the very bottom of the
particles. So if you go here to cycles,

160
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:50,800
particles. So if you go here to cycles,
 

161
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,030
particles. So if you go here to cycles,
you'll be able to see particles and a

162
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,040
you'll be able to see particles and a
 

163
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,710
you'll be able to see particles and a
floor. And it's cool and it's great. And

164
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:54,720
floor. And it's cool and it's great. And
 

165
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,150
floor. And it's cool and it's great. And
you can actually hit this drop down up

166
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,160
you can actually hit this drop down up
 

167
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,150
you can actually hit this drop down up
here and click scene world scene lights.

168
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:58,160
here and click scene world scene lights.
 

169
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,509
here and click scene world scene lights.
And you don't have to add lighting right

170
00:02:59,509 --> 00:02:59,519
And you don't have to add lighting right
 

171
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,270
And you don't have to add lighting right
now to be able to kind of see this and

172
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:01,280
now to be able to kind of see this and
 

173
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,110
now to be able to kind of see this and
appreciate it. Now that we've created

174
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:03,120
appreciate it. Now that we've created
 

175
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,830
appreciate it. Now that we've created
our particles, let's go ahead and use

176
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:05,840
our particles, let's go ahead and use
 

177
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,550
our particles, let's go ahead and use
our image to delete the particles that

178
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:08,560
our image to delete the particles that
 

179
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,550
our image to delete the particles that
are going to take up the space of the

180
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:10,560
are going to take up the space of the
 

181
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,070
are going to take up the space of the
text. So, what we're going to do is get

182
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,080
text. So, what we're going to do is get
 

183
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,589
text. So, what we're going to do is get
a

184
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:13,599
a
 

185
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,309
a
delete geometry node. Make sure it says

186
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:16,319
delete geometry node. Make sure it says
 

187
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,390
delete geometry node. Make sure it says
points, but that's default, so it should

188
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:18,400
points, but that's default, so it should
 

189
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,710
points, but that's default, so it should
say it. We're going to get a image

190
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:20,720
say it. We're going to get a image
 

191
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,309
say it. We're going to get a image
texture.

192
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:22,319
texture.
 

193
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,390
texture.
Plug this right here into selection and

194
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:24,400
Plug this right here into selection and
 

195
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,309
Plug this right here into selection and
go here and open up your image. So now

196
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:28,319
go here and open up your image. So now
 

197
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,789
go here and open up your image. So now
if you see some weird things happening,

198
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:30,799
if you see some weird things happening,
 

199
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,030
if you see some weird things happening,
just know that means uh your image is

200
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,040
just know that means uh your image is
 

201
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,390
just know that means uh your image is
working. You can see it kind of getting

202
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:34,400
working. You can see it kind of getting
 

203
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,110
working. You can see it kind of getting
tile uh tiled all over here. So right

204
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:37,120
tile uh tiled all over here. So right
 

205
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,990
tile uh tiled all over here. So right
over here, go from repeat to clip. And

206
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:40,000
over here, go from repeat to clip. And
 

207
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,430
over here, go from repeat to clip. And
then we're going to get a couple nodes.

208
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:41,440
then we're going to get a couple nodes.
 

209
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,630
then we're going to get a couple nodes.
You can kind of see it happening right

210
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:42,640
You can kind of see it happening right
 

211
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,550
You can kind of see it happening right
there. Um so that's where my image is

212
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:44,560
there. Um so that's where my image is
 

213
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,390
there. Um so that's where my image is
existing. It's too small. It's just not

214
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:46,400
existing. It's too small. It's just not
 

215
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,470
existing. It's too small. It's just not
what we want. So what I'm going to do is

216
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:48,480
what we want. So what I'm going to do is
 

217
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,270
what we want. So what I'm going to do is
to get a position node. And what we're

218
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:51,280
to get a position node. And what we're
 

219
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,789
to get a position node. And what we're
going to create is a texture coordinate.

220
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:54,799
going to create is a texture coordinate.
 

221
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,470
going to create is a texture coordinate.
um they we don't have a texture

222
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:56,480
um they we don't have a texture
 

223
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,470
um they we don't have a texture
coordinate uh in the same exact way that

224
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:58,480
coordinate uh in the same exact way that
 

225
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,229
coordinate uh in the same exact way that
we do in um in the shading workspace. So

226
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:02,239
we do in um in the shading workspace. So
 

227
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,550
we do in um in the shading workspace. So
we can build it though. So position just

228
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:04,560
we can build it though. So position just
 

229
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,630
we can build it though. So position just
is important to know. Hey, there's space

230
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:06,640
is important to know. Hey, there's space
 

231
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,229
is important to know. Hey, there's space
here. So we're going to get in a

232
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:10,239
here. So we're going to get in a
 

233
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,390
here. So we're going to get in a
vector math node. He is going to

234
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:12,400
vector math node. He is going to
 

235
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,070
vector math node. He is going to
represent position. So we'll plug him

236
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:14,080
represent position. So we'll plug him
 

237
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,990
represent position. So we'll plug him
there. Just the add. And then we're

238
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,000
there. Just the add. And then we're
 

239
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,430
there. Just the add. And then we're
going to go ahead and get in uh

240
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:17,440
going to go ahead and get in uh
 

241
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,030
going to go ahead and get in uh
duplicate him. Switch him over to

242
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,040
duplicate him. Switch him over to
 

243
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,390
duplicate him. Switch him over to
multiply. He is going to represent the

244
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,400
multiply. He is going to represent the
 

245
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,070
multiply. He is going to represent the
scale function in a texture coordinate.

246
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,080
scale function in a texture coordinate.
 

247
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,150
scale function in a texture coordinate.
and you can plug it there. So now bring

248
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:26,160
and you can plug it there. So now bring
 

249
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,270
and you can plug it there. So now bring
your multiply back to one. In fact, if

250
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:29,280
your multiply back to one. In fact, if
 

251
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,189
your multiply back to one. In fact, if
you just bring it up like that, you will

252
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:31,199
you just bring it up like that, you will
 

253
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,510
you just bring it up like that, you will
start to see it happening. And because

254
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:33,520
start to see it happening. And because
 

255
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,310
start to see it happening. And because
this is like a scale, it also means you

256
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:36,320
this is like a scale, it also means you
 

257
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,629
this is like a scale, it also means you
can stretch and squash. Now this is your

258
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:38,639
can stretch and squash. Now this is your
 

259
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,110
can stretch and squash. Now this is your
position. So you can bring and center

260
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,120
position. So you can bring and center
 

261
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,950
position. So you can bring and center
out this thing. Of course, right now we

262
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:42,960
out this thing. Of course, right now we
 

263
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,670
out this thing. Of course, right now we
just need to actually scale it up. Um so

264
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:45,680
just need to actually scale it up. Um so
 

265
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,469
just need to actually scale it up. Um so
it will start to stretch around um in a

266
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:50,479
it will start to stretch around um in a
 

267
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:51,590
it will start to stretch around um in a
way that you don't want as you're

268
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:51,600
way that you don't want as you're
 

269
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,350
way that you don't want as you're
playing around with it. So it is just

270
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:53,360
playing around with it. So it is just
 

271
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,110
playing around with it. So it is just
going to uh it's going to be a matter of

272
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:55,120
going to uh it's going to be a matter of
 

273
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,469
going to uh it's going to be a matter of
just massaging this image until it takes

274
00:04:58,469 --> 00:04:58,479
just massaging this image until it takes
 

275
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,390
just massaging this image until it takes
the form however you want it to. So

276
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:02,400
the form however you want it to. So
 

277
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,350
the form however you want it to. So
something like

278
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:05,360
something like
 

279
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,270
something like
this. There are some more sort of

280
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:07,280
this. There are some more sort of
 

281
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,270
this. There are some more sort of
intricate ways to actually get it to

282
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:09,280
intricate ways to actually get it to
 

283
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,510
intricate ways to actually get it to
perfectly map. Um I'm not really I'm not

284
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:13,520
perfectly map. Um I'm not really I'm not
 

285
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,150
perfectly map. Um I'm not really I'm not
going to be that exact about it. So now

286
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:16,160
going to be that exact about it. So now
 

287
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,029
going to be that exact about it. So now
we have an image that deletes objects.

288
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:19,039
we have an image that deletes objects.
 

289
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,870
we have an image that deletes objects.
We can see look at that. It works. Now

290
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:22,880
We can see look at that. It works. Now
 

291
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,590
We can see look at that. It works. Now
the next thing I want to do is use

292
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:25,600
the next thing I want to do is use
 

293
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,390
the next thing I want to do is use
displacement to animate all these

294
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:28,400
displacement to animate all these
 

295
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,550
displacement to animate all these
particles. And that's where hierarchy is

296
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:30,560
particles. And that's where hierarchy is
 

297
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,550
particles. And that's where hierarchy is
going to be very important. If we add

298
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:32,560
going to be very important. If we add
 

299
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,110
going to be very important. If we add
our displacement here, which let's just

300
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,120
our displacement here, which let's just
 

301
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,110
our displacement here, which let's just
go ahead and I'm going to show you

302
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,120
go ahead and I'm going to show you
 

303
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,110
go ahead and I'm going to show you
what'll happen. If I do this, and then I

304
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:39,120
what'll happen. If I do this, and then I
 

305
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,029
what'll happen. If I do this, and then I
add my noise texture to my set position

306
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:41,039
add my noise texture to my set position
 

307
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,790
add my noise texture to my set position
node and I click normalize and add

308
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:42,800
node and I click normalize and add
 

309
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,950
node and I click normalize and add
color.

310
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:44,960
color.
 

311
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,790
color.
Where' our text go? Right, that's

312
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:46,800
Where' our text go? Right, that's
 

313
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,029
Where' our text go? Right, that's
because the action is happening after

314
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:49,039
because the action is happening after
 

315
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,029
because the action is happening after
the formation of the text. We need to

316
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:51,039
the formation of the text. We need to
 

317
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,029
the formation of the text. We need to
displace our particles before the

318
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:53,039
displace our particles before the
 

319
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,629
displace our particles before the
formation of the text, before the

320
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:54,639
formation of the text, before the
 

321
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,029
formation of the text, before the
function of the deleting. And so what we

322
00:05:57,029 --> 00:05:57,039
function of the deleting. And so what we
 

323
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,469
function of the deleting. And so what we
need to do instead of putting set

324
00:05:58,469 --> 00:05:58,479
need to do instead of putting set
 

325
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,189
need to do instead of putting set
position after, put it before. And that

326
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:01,199
position after, put it before. And that
 

327
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,629
position after, put it before. And that
is going to be the only thing we need to

328
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:02,639
is going to be the only thing we need to
 

329
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,790
is going to be the only thing we need to
do. So just go ahead, get a set position

330
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:04,800
do. So just go ahead, get a set position
 

331
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,469
do. So just go ahead, get a set position
node, go and get in a noise texture. And

332
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:08,479
node, go and get in a noise texture. And
 

333
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,309
node, go and get in a noise texture. And
we're going to plug color right into

334
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:10,319
we're going to plug color right into
 

335
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,230
we're going to plug color right into
offset. And notice, bring that detail

336
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:12,240
offset. And notice, bring that detail
 

337
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,790
offset. And notice, bring that detail
down. Bring that scale up. No matter

338
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:14,800
down. Bring that scale up. No matter
 

339
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,150
down. Bring that scale up. No matter
what we do and switch this over to 4D,

340
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:18,160
what we do and switch this over to 4D,
 

341
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,150
what we do and switch this over to 4D,
that text is staying put. And that is

342
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,160
that text is staying put. And that is
 

343
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,150
that text is staying put. And that is
exactly what we want. I'm going to go

344
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:22,160
exactly what we want. I'm going to go
 

345
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,990
exactly what we want. I'm going to go
ahead and I'm going to bring up the

346
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,000
ahead and I'm going to bring up the
 

347
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,670
ahead and I'm going to bring up the
scale of my uh

348
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:27,680
scale of my uh
 

349
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,230
scale of my uh
box just because I know um it's going to

350
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:30,240
box just because I know um it's going to
 

351
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,909
box just because I know um it's going to
be moving around quite a bit. So I'm

352
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:31,919
be moving around quite a bit. So I'm
 

353
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,110
be moving around quite a bit. So I'm
going to go ahead here to the top. I'm

354
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:33,120
going to go ahead here to the top. I'm
 

355
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,270
going to go ahead here to the top. I'm
hit shift A. Get a camera control alt0

356
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:37,280
hit shift A. Get a camera control alt0
 

357
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,990
hit shift A. Get a camera control alt0
and snap it to view.

358
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,000
and snap it to view.
 

359
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,710
and snap it to view.
And I want my

360
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:42,720
And I want my
 

361
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,230
And I want my
text to be like this. So now I know,

362
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:44,240
text to be like this. So now I know,
 

363
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,830
text to be like this. So now I know,
hey, the text needs to be centered out a

364
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:45,840
hey, the text needs to be centered out a
 

365
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,790
hey, the text needs to be centered out a
little bit. So, we'll go back to our

366
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:46,800
little bit. So, we'll go back to our
 

367
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,629
little bit. So, we'll go back to our
mapping nodes and say, "Hey,

368
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:50,639
mapping nodes and say, "Hey,
 

369
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,070
mapping nodes and say, "Hey,
stay in the middle." All right. Next is

370
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,080
stay in the middle." All right. Next is
 

371
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,870
stay in the middle." All right. Next is
the scale of our points. They're kind of

372
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:56,880
the scale of our points. They're kind of
 

373
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,790
the scale of our points. They're kind of
big. Um, particle systems, at least ones

374
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:00,800
big. Um, particle systems, at least ones
 

375
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,430
big. Um, particle systems, at least ones
like this, they tend to look better at

376
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:03,440
like this, they tend to look better at
 

377
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,230
like this, they tend to look better at
higher volumes and smaller scales. This

378
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:06,240
higher volumes and smaller scales. This
 

379
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,390
higher volumes and smaller scales. This
is just kind of glob and ugly. And so,

380
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:08,400
is just kind of glob and ugly. And so,
 

381
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,309
is just kind of glob and ugly. And so,
what we can do is get a set

382
00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:12,319
what we can do is get a set
 

383
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,670
what we can do is get a set
point radius. And then you can start to

384
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:15,680
point radius. And then you can start to
 

385
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,870
point radius. And then you can start to
bring that down to maybe 0.02.

386
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:18,880
bring that down to maybe 0.02.
 

387
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,469
bring that down to maybe 0.02.
There we go. Very small. Which means

388
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:22,479
There we go. Very small. Which means
 

389
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,629
There we go. Very small. Which means
we just need to bring up the density

390
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:26,639
we just need to bring up the density
 

391
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,790
we just need to bring up the density
of our displacement. Now, here's one

392
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:28,800
of our displacement. Now, here's one
 

393
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,350
of our displacement. Now, here's one
thing that I want to change. Notice the

394
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:31,360
thing that I want to change. Notice the
 

395
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,670
thing that I want to change. Notice the
uh displacement is going to be on X, Y,

396
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:33,680
uh displacement is going to be on X, Y,
 

397
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,189
uh displacement is going to be on X, Y,
and the Z in terms of our uh set

398
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:37,199
and the Z in terms of our uh set
 

399
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,070
and the Z in terms of our uh set
position. I don't want that. I only want

400
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,080
position. I don't want that. I only want
 

401
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,550
position. I don't want that. I only want
the displacement to happen this way. I

402
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:42,560
the displacement to happen this way. I
 

403
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,950
the displacement to happen this way. I
don't want it to happen that way. I want

404
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:44,960
don't want it to happen that way. I want
 

405
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,110
don't want it to happen that way. I want
it to be perfectly flat. So, what we can

406
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:47,120
it to be perfectly flat. So, what we can
 

407
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,950
it to be perfectly flat. So, what we can
do here on the noise texture, make sure

408
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:48,960
do here on the noise texture, make sure
 

409
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,070
do here on the noise texture, make sure
you are unchecking normalize. And then

410
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,080
you are unchecking normalize. And then
 

411
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,469
you are unchecking normalize. And then
what we need to do is get a vector math

412
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:54,479
what we need to do is get a vector math
 

413
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,110
what we need to do is get a vector math
node. Set that to a multiply. And what

414
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,120
node. Set that to a multiply. And what
 

415
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,790
node. Set that to a multiply. And what
that's going to let us do is actually

416
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:58,800
that's going to let us do is actually
 

417
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,350
that's going to let us do is actually
not only play with the strength of the

418
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:01,360
not only play with the strength of the
 

419
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,790
not only play with the strength of the
displacement that we're giving it, which

420
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:02,800
displacement that we're giving it, which
 

421
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,990
displacement that we're giving it, which
will automatically make it really more

422
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:06,000
will automatically make it really more
 

423
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,990
will automatically make it really more
wiggly and more interesting and just a

424
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,000
wiggly and more interesting and just a
 

425
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,990
wiggly and more interesting and just a
little bit more fun to look at, but also

426
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,000
little bit more fun to look at, but also
 

427
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,710
little bit more fun to look at, but also
is going to say, "Hey, don't don't

428
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:12,720
is going to say, "Hey, don't don't
 

429
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,790
is going to say, "Hey, don't don't
displace it that way. Keep it on the

430
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:14,800
displace it that way. Keep it on the
 

431
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,189
displace it that way. Keep it on the
flat." Cuz that's going to help with the

432
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:17,199
flat." Cuz that's going to help with the
 

433
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,230
flat." Cuz that's going to help with the
effect that we're going for. And also

434
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:20,240
effect that we're going for. And also
 

435
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,869
effect that we're going for. And also
just lets us play with it on the X and

436
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:22,879
just lets us play with it on the X and
 

437
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,510
just lets us play with it on the X and
the Y. And then when we animate it, it

438
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:25,520
the Y. And then when we animate it, it
 

439
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,790
the Y. And then when we animate it, it
will look really, really cool. So now we

440
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:28,800
will look really, really cool. So now we
 

441
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,070
will look really, really cool. So now we
have this. You can play with uh the

442
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:32,080
have this. You can play with uh the
 

443
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,630
have this. You can play with uh the
radius of your objects if you want a

444
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:34,640
radius of your objects if you want a
 

445
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,110
radius of your objects if you want a
little bit more. To me, it's going to be

446
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:37,120
little bit more. To me, it's going to be
 

447
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,110
little bit more. To me, it's going to be
01

448
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:39,120
01
 

449
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,550
01
at a higher density. So what are we at?

450
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:42,560
at a higher density. So what are we at?
 

451
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,790
at a higher density. So what are we at?
180. Let's do like 600.

452
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:46,800
180. Let's do like 600.
 

453
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,470
180. Let's do like 600.
So that looks cool. Now, it's not going

454
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:48,480
So that looks cool. Now, it's not going
 

455
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,470
So that looks cool. Now, it's not going
to look quite as obvious until we start

456
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:50,480
to look quite as obvious until we start
 

457
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,790
to look quite as obvious until we start
adding colors. So, let's go ahead and

458
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:52,800
adding colors. So, let's go ahead and
 

459
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,350
adding colors. So, let's go ahead and
start to add some shading to this. But I

460
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:55,360
start to add some shading to this. But I
 

461
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,110
start to add some shading to this. But I
want this noise texture to influence the

462
00:08:59,110 --> 00:08:59,120
want this noise texture to influence the
 

463
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,389
want this noise texture to influence the
colors that we're going to see on our

464
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:00,399
colors that we're going to see on our
 

465
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,230
colors that we're going to see on our
particles. So, what we can do is right

466
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:02,240
particles. So, what we can do is right
 

467
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,430
particles. So, what we can do is right
after the set point radius, get a set

468
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:05,440
after the set point radius, get a set
 

469
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,070
after the set point radius, get a set
material node right over here, we can

470
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:08,080
material node right over here, we can
 

471
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,750
material node right over here, we can
just go ahead and click new. He's just

472
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:09,760
just go ahead and click new. He's just
 

473
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,350
just go ahead and click new. He's just
called 001. We'll go ahead and grab 001.

474
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:13,360
called 001. We'll go ahead and grab 001.
 

475
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,110
called 001. We'll go ahead and grab 001.
And then we can get a

476
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,120
And then we can get a
 

477
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,470
And then we can get a
we can hit shift A and get a store named

478
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:20,480
we can hit shift A and get a store named
 

479
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,829
we can hit shift A and get a store named
attribute. I'm going to say C for color.

480
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:23,839
attribute. I'm going to say C for color.
 

481
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,269
attribute. I'm going to say C for color.
Everything's lagging a little bit, so

482
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:25,279
Everything's lagging a little bit, so
 

483
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,550
Everything's lagging a little bit, so
I'm just going to bring my density down

484
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:26,560
I'm just going to bring my density down
 

485
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,990
I'm just going to bring my density down
to like 300 for now.

486
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:30,000
to like 300 for now.
 

487
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,750
to like 300 for now.
And then we can just go ahead and take

488
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:31,760
And then we can just go ahead and take
 

489
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,110
And then we can just go ahead and take
this color, plug it right into value.

490
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,120
this color, plug it right into value.
 

491
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,710
this color, plug it right into value.
And now we have that. And we can switch

492
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:36,720
And now we have that. And we can switch
 

493
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,110
And now we have that. And we can switch
this guy over to the shader editor. I'm

494
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:39,120
this guy over to the shader editor. I'm
 

495
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,350
this guy over to the shader editor. I'm
going to go back here to the view. Let's

496
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:41,360
going to go back here to the view. Let's
 

497
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,870
going to go back here to the view. Let's
go ahead and grab that attribute. So, we

498
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:42,880
go ahead and grab that attribute. So, we
 

499
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,070
go ahead and grab that attribute. So, we
got attribute right here, C for color,

500
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,080
got attribute right here, C for color,
 

501
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,070
got attribute right here, C for color,
and let's plug color right into color.

502
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:48,080
and let's plug color right into color.
 

503
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,230
and let's plug color right into color.
So, now we have this. So, now let's go

504
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:50,240
So, now we have this. So, now let's go
 

505
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,630
So, now we have this. So, now let's go
ahead and get a color ramp and select uh

506
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:52,640
ahead and get a color ramp and select uh
 

507
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,990
ahead and get a color ramp and select uh
some really cool colors. So, we're going

508
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:54,000
some really cool colors. So, we're going
 

509
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,870
some really cool colors. So, we're going
to go ahead get this a color ramp. And a

510
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:56,880
to go ahead get this a color ramp. And a
 

511
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,310
to go ahead get this a color ramp. And a
fun little trick is I'm going to go

512
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:58,320
fun little trick is I'm going to go
 

513
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,030
fun little trick is I'm going to go
switch this over to a HSV, switch this

514
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:01,040
switch this over to a HSV, switch this
 

515
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,710
switch this over to a HSV, switch this
to far, and then this color just make it

516
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:04,720
to far, and then this color just make it
 

517
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,190
to far, and then this color just make it
red. It's going to create this big kind

518
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:07,200
red. It's going to create this big kind
 

519
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,269
red. It's going to create this big kind
of rainbow situation. And then once you

520
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:09,279
of rainbow situation. And then once you
 

521
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,750
of rainbow situation. And then once you
have that established, you can go get a

522
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:11,760
have that established, you can go get a
 

523
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,550
have that established, you can go get a
hue, saturation, value node and play

524
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:14,560
hue, saturation, value node and play
 

525
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,110
hue, saturation, value node and play
around with values until you start to

526
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:19,120
around with values until you start to
 

527
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,269
around with values until you start to
like the situation that you're in. This

528
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:21,279
like the situation that you're in. This
 

529
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,870
like the situation that you're in. This
is cool. I think we can run with this

530
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:22,880
is cool. I think we can run with this
 

531
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,550
is cool. I think we can run with this
one um for this tutorial. This looks

532
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:26,560
one um for this tutorial. This looks
 

533
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,470
one um for this tutorial. This looks
awesome. And then now we can just go

534
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:28,480
awesome. And then now we can just go
 

535
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,910
awesome. And then now we can just go
ahead back to the geometry nodes editor

536
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:31,920
ahead back to the geometry nodes editor
 

537
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,750
ahead back to the geometry nodes editor
and just see how it would look as final

538
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:33,760
and just see how it would look as final
 

539
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,509
and just see how it would look as final
density. So, what? 1,000. No, 600.

540
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:37,519
density. So, what? 1,000. No, 600.
 

541
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,750
density. So, what? 1,000. No, 600.
600 on the density. There we go. This is

542
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:39,760
600 on the density. There we go. This is
 

543
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,630
600 on the density. There we go. This is
how it would look as a final. Now, we're

544
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:42,640
how it would look as a final. Now, we're
 

545
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,350
how it would look as a final. Now, we're
not quite done yet. This bottom color, I

546
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:45,360
not quite done yet. This bottom color, I
 

547
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,590
not quite done yet. This bottom color, I
do want to go ahead and select that. So,

548
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:47,600
do want to go ahead and select that. So,
 

549
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,990
do want to go ahead and select that. So,
I'm just going to click on the bottom um

550
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm just going to click on the bottom um
 

551
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,509
I'm just going to click on the bottom um
t that's geometry notes. We'll just go

552
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:51,519
t that's geometry notes. We'll just go
 

553
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,230
t that's geometry notes. We'll just go
over here and then say make it kind of

554
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:54,240
over here and then say make it kind of
 

555
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,069
over here and then say make it kind of
like that yellow that we're getting

556
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:56,079
like that yellow that we're getting
 

557
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,150
like that yellow that we're getting
beneath. That'll kind of keep everything

558
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:58,160
beneath. That'll kind of keep everything
 

559
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,990
beneath. That'll kind of keep everything
cohesive. You can even make it, you

560
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,000
cohesive. You can even make it, you
 

561
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,389
cohesive. You can even make it, you
know, like a light purple if you want.

562
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:02,399
know, like a light purple if you want.
 

563
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,670
know, like a light purple if you want.
uh just kind of keeping it in the

564
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:03,680
uh just kind of keeping it in the
 

565
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,750
uh just kind of keeping it in the
family. You can even make it emissive.

566
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:05,760
family. You can even make it emissive.
 

567
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,110
family. You can even make it emissive.
Uh but in this case, we're just going to

568
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:07,120
Uh but in this case, we're just going to
 

569
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,190
Uh but in this case, we're just going to
keep it uh like this so it's nice and

570
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:09,200
keep it uh like this so it's nice and
 

571
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,829
keep it uh like this so it's nice and
readable. Now, for lighting, uh with

572
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:11,839
readable. Now, for lighting, uh with
 

573
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,990
readable. Now, for lighting, uh with
shots like this, you can actually go

574
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,000
shots like this, you can actually go
 

575
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,550
shots like this, you can actually go
simpler, and that's going to give you uh

576
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:16,560
simpler, and that's going to give you uh
 

577
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,310
simpler, and that's going to give you uh
a more interesting looking animation.

578
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:18,320
a more interesting looking animation.
 

579
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,670
a more interesting looking animation.
So, I'm going to hit the drop down, hits

580
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:19,680
So, I'm going to hit the drop down, hits
 

581
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,750
So, I'm going to hit the drop down, hits
on, hit on scene, world, scene, lights,

582
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:21,760
on, hit on scene, world, scene, lights,
 

583
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,710
on, hit on scene, world, scene, lights,
and we're going to go get a light area.

584
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:24,720
and we're going to go get a light area.
 

585
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,030
and we're going to go get a light area.
Hit up. Let's see. We need to go see the

586
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,040
Hit up. Let's see. We need to go see the
 

587
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,509
Hit up. Let's see. We need to go see the
gizmos. I'm going to go here to actually

588
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:29,519
gizmos. I'm going to go here to actually
 

589
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,750
gizmos. I'm going to go here to actually
we'll just keep it flat.

590
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:31,760
we'll just keep it flat.
 

591
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,870
we'll just keep it flat.
And then we'll bring it up.

592
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:36,880

 

593
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,630

I always put my lights way too close.

594
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:40,640
I always put my lights way too close.
 

595
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,310
I always put my lights way too close.
And I'm going hit R twice. And then

596
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:42,320
And I'm going hit R twice. And then
 

597
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,990
And I'm going hit R twice. And then
scale the thing up pretty aggressively.

598
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:46,000
scale the thing up pretty aggressively.
 

599
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,910
scale the thing up pretty aggressively.
And then give your power of like 3,000.

600
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:49,920
And then give your power of like 3,000.
 

601
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,910
And then give your power of like 3,000.
So that's starting to look good. Um,

602
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:51,920
So that's starting to look good. Um,
 

603
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,910
So that's starting to look good. Um,
let's bring that spread in a little bit.

604
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:53,920
let's bring that spread in a little bit.
 

605
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,389
let's bring that spread in a little bit.
And then you can go maybe uh 10,000.

606
00:11:58,389 --> 00:11:58,399
And then you can go maybe uh 10,000.
 

607
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,230
And then you can go maybe uh 10,000.
All right, that looks that looks pretty

608
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:00,240
All right, that looks that looks pretty
 

609
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,750
All right, that looks that looks pretty
good. And then you can also bring your

610
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:01,760
good. And then you can also bring your
 

611
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,190
good. And then you can also bring your
world brightness up a little bit if you

612
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:03,200
world brightness up a little bit if you
 

613
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,550
world brightness up a little bit if you
want to even out those shadows or make

614
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:04,560
want to even out those shadows or make
 

615
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,990
want to even out those shadows or make
the shadows really aggressive and make

616
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:06,000
the shadows really aggressive and make
 

617
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,310
the shadows really aggressive and make
them super dark. Whatever you want to

618
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:08,320
them super dark. Whatever you want to
 

619
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,310
them super dark. Whatever you want to
do. And then here in the particle

620
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:10,320
do. And then here in the particle
 

621
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,269
do. And then here in the particle
system, I'm going to go open up that

622
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:13,279
system, I'm going to go open up that
 

623
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,949
system, I'm going to go open up that
window again that I sadly deleted. And

624
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:16,959
window again that I sadly deleted. And
 

625
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,550
window again that I sadly deleted. And
I'm going to bring up my density again.

626
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:18,560
I'm going to bring up my density again.
 

627
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,069
I'm going to bring up my density again.
So right now it's at 600. We're going to

628
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:20,079
So right now it's at 600. We're going to
 

629
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,430
So right now it's at 600. We're going to
do 1200

630
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:23,440
do 1200
 

631
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,150
do 1200
to make it fully nice and dense. And

632
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:26,160
to make it fully nice and dense. And
 

633
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,670
to make it fully nice and dense. And
then let's go ahead and render this out

634
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:27,680
then let's go ahead and render this out
 

635
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,269
then let's go ahead and render this out
and see how this would look as a final

636
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:29,279
and see how this would look as a final
 

637
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,670
and see how this would look as a final
image. All right. So, this is a final

638
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:31,680
image. All right. So, this is a final
 

639
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,949
image. All right. So, this is a final
look at what it would look like

640
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:32,959
look at what it would look like
 

641
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,629
look at what it would look like
rendered. One thing I think is the

642
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:34,639
rendered. One thing I think is the
 

643
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,350
rendered. One thing I think is the
shadows are too long for what I want it

644
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:37,360
shadows are too long for what I want it
 

645
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,550
shadows are too long for what I want it
to be. So, I'm going to just go ahead

646
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:40,560
to be. So, I'm going to just go ahead
 

647
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,389
to be. So, I'm going to just go ahead
and that tells me I just want to bring

648
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:42,399
and that tells me I just want to bring
 

649
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,870
and that tells me I just want to bring
up the height

650
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:44,880
up the height
 

651
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,430
up the height
of my light. So, I'm just going to go

652
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:47,440
of my light. So, I'm just going to go
 

653
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,670
of my light. So, I'm just going to go
ahead and say go up a little bit and

654
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:51,680
ahead and say go up a little bit and
 

655
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,310
ahead and say go up a little bit and
then point down. I still want a little

656
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:54,320
then point down. I still want a little
 

657
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,990
then point down. I still want a little
bit of that like what I'm getting. So,

658
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:56,000
bit of that like what I'm getting. So,
 

659
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,750
bit of that like what I'm getting. So,
that looks super nice. Now, what we need

660
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:57,760
that looks super nice. Now, what we need
 

661
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,150
that looks super nice. Now, what we need
to do is just animate our particles uh

662
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:00,160
to do is just animate our particles uh
 

663
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,230
to do is just animate our particles uh
in a loop so that this looks really

664
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:02,240
in a loop so that this looks really
 

665
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,230
in a loop so that this looks really
cool. So, that would be the W of this

666
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:04,240
cool. So, that would be the W of this
 

667
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,829
cool. So, that would be the W of this
noise texture. Right now, it's way too

668
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:05,839
noise texture. Right now, it's way too
 

669
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,350
noise texture. Right now, it's way too
dense to see that in real time. So, I'm

670
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:07,360
dense to see that in real time. So, I'm
 

671
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,990
dense to see that in real time. So, I'm
going to do maybe a density of 50 for

672
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:10,000
going to do maybe a density of 50 for
 

673
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,590
going to do maybe a density of 50 for
now so we can look at these particles

674
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:11,600
now so we can look at these particles
 

675
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,750
now so we can look at these particles
move in real time. So, let's go ahead.

676
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:13,760
move in real time. So, let's go ahead.
 

677
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,430
move in real time. So, let's go ahead.
I'm going to highlight this and hit G

678
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:15,440
I'm going to highlight this and hit G
 

679
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,509
I'm going to highlight this and hit G
and move them down. And let's go ahead

680
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:17,519
and move them down. And let's go ahead
 

681
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,790
and move them down. And let's go ahead
and get ourselves some space. So,

682
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:20,800
and get ourselves some space. So,
 

683
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,750
and get ourselves some space. So,
I'm going to hit I'm going to hit shift

684
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:23,760
I'm going to hit I'm going to hit shift
 

685
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,990
I'm going to hit I'm going to hit shift
and rightclick just to keep these two

686
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:26,000
and rightclick just to keep these two
 

687
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,990
and rightclick just to keep these two
connections uh the same. I'm going to go

688
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:28,000
connections uh the same. I'm going to go
 

689
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,069
connections uh the same. I'm going to go
ahead here on the W, make it zero. We're

690
00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:30,079
ahead here on the W, make it zero. We're
 

691
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,829
ahead here on the W, make it zero. We're
going to duplicate this noise texture.

692
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:31,839
going to duplicate this noise texture.
 

693
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,190
going to duplicate this noise texture.
We're going to get a mix color node and

694
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:35,200
We're going to get a mix color node and
 

695
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,350
We're going to get a mix color node and
plug these two here. So, now what we're

696
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:37,360
plug these two here. So, now what we're
 

697
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,310
plug these two here. So, now what we're
going to do is loop the W. So, now the

698
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:40,320
going to do is loop the W. So, now the
 

699
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,710
going to do is loop the W. So, now the
scale is really small. So, the W values

700
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:42,720
scale is really small. So, the W values
 

701
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,829
scale is really small. So, the W values
are going to need to be pretty high for

702
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:43,839
are going to need to be pretty high for
 

703
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,230
are going to need to be pretty high for
this to to move. I mean, relatively

704
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:46,240
this to to move. I mean, relatively
 

705
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,949
this to to move. I mean, relatively
fast. So, what I'll do is we'll go make

706
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:48,959
fast. So, what I'll do is we'll go make
 

707
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,949
fast. So, what I'll do is we'll go make
sure in your preferences in the

708
00:13:50,949 --> 00:13:50,959
sure in your preferences in the
 

709
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,069
sure in your preferences in the
animation tab, your default

710
00:13:52,069 --> 00:13:52,079
animation tab, your default
 

711
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,150
animation tab, your default
interpolation is linear. And then what

712
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:54,160
interpolation is linear. And then what
 

713
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,670
interpolation is linear. And then what
I'll do is here in the W, I'm going to

714
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:55,680
I'll do is here in the W, I'm going to
 

715
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,910
I'll do is here in the W, I'm going to
hit I. Here in the factor, bring it to

716
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:57,920
hit I. Here in the factor, bring it to
 

717
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,590
hit I. Here in the factor, bring it to
the left, hit I. I'm going to go to the

718
00:13:59,590 --> 00:13:59,600
the left, hit I. I'm going to go to the
 

719
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,990
the left, hit I. I'm going to go to the
end, bring that factor over, hit I, and

720
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:02,000
end, bring that factor over, hit I, and
 

721
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,269
end, bring that factor over, hit I, and
then we're going to do a uh a scale of

722
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:05,279
then we're going to do a uh a scale of
 

723
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,750
then we're going to do a uh a scale of
four. And then right here, now that

724
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:07,760
four. And then right here, now that
 

725
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,870
four. And then right here, now that
we're at the very end, hit I. Go to the

726
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:10,880
we're at the very end, hit I. Go to the
 

727
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,949
we're at the very end, hit I. Go to the
end and type in -4 because we did

728
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:12,959
end and type in -4 because we did
 

729
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,030
end and type in -4 because we did
positive four on the other one. And we

730
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:15,040
positive four on the other one. And we
 

731
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,870
positive four on the other one. And we
should see, let's see, is this real

732
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:16,880
should see, let's see, is this real
 

733
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,389
should see, let's see, is this real
time? That's 14 frames a second. So, we

734
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:20,399
time? That's 14 frames a second. So, we
 

735
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,790
time? That's 14 frames a second. So, we
need to bring this density to like 10.

736
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:24,800
need to bring this density to like 10.
 

737
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,310
need to bring this density to like 10.
There we go. So, this is real time. So,

738
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:26,320
There we go. So, this is real time. So,
 

739
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,470
There we go. So, this is real time. So,
this is as fast as your particles are

740
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:28,480
this is as fast as your particles are
 

741
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,870
this is as fast as your particles are
going to be moving um once you're done

742
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:30,880
going to be moving um once you're done
 

743
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,389
going to be moving um once you're done
rendering it. I think this is a really

744
00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:32,399
rendering it. I think this is a really
 

745
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,389
rendering it. I think this is a really
nice speed. Now, for my final, I'm going

746
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:34,399
nice speed. Now, for my final, I'm going
 

747
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,990
nice speed. Now, for my final, I'm going
to go ahead and save my file. And then

748
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:36,000
to go ahead and save my file. And then
 

749
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,110
to go ahead and save my file. And then
for my final, I want my density to be

750
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:39,120
for my final, I want my density to be
 

751
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,069
for my final, I want my density to be
1,200. So, we have a lot of particles.

752
00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:42,079
1,200. So, we have a lot of particles.
 

753
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,829
1,200. So, we have a lot of particles.
The lighting will hit them. The thing

754
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:43,839
The lighting will hit them. The thing
 

755
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,430
The lighting will hit them. The thing
about having lots of uh thing about

756
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:45,440
about having lots of uh thing about
 

757
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,430
about having lots of uh thing about
particle systems is if you have small

758
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:47,440
particle systems is if you have small
 

759
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,750
particle systems is if you have small
particles, you need a large volume of

760
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:49,760
particles, you need a large volume of
 

761
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,750
particles, you need a large volume of
them in order for the lighting to

762
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:51,760
them in order for the lighting to
 

763
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,790
them in order for the lighting to
actually uh hit it and look good and it

764
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:54,800
actually uh hit it and look good and it
 

765
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,269
actually uh hit it and look good and it
feel nice. Uh much like making this

766
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:57,279
feel nice. Uh much like making this
 

767
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,189
feel nice. Uh much like making this
whole particle system as a collective be

768
00:14:59,189 --> 00:14:59,199
whole particle system as a collective be
 

769
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,990
whole particle system as a collective be
one single solid object. So that is uh

770
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:02,000
one single solid object. So that is uh
 

771
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,590
one single solid object. So that is uh
sometimes why maybe you feel like your

772
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:03,600
sometimes why maybe you feel like your
 

773
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,110
sometimes why maybe you feel like your
particle systems don't look good. It's

774
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:05,120
particle systems don't look good. It's
 

775
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,030
particle systems don't look good. It's
because you don't have enough particles.

776
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,040
because you don't have enough particles.
 

777
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,629
because you don't have enough particles.
But now that we're finished, this is a

778
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:08,639
But now that we're finished, this is a
 

779
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,389
But now that we're finished, this is a
final. I can actually say, okay, make it

780
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:10,399
final. I can actually say, okay, make it
 

781
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,230
final. I can actually say, okay, make it
the full density. We can go ahead and

782
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:12,240
the full density. We can go ahead and
 

783
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,629
the full density. We can go ahead and
render this out. So, as for your render

784
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:14,639
render this out. So, as for your render
 

785
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,750
render this out. So, as for your render
settings, I'm going to go 1920 x 1080.

786
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:17,760
settings, I'm going to go 1920 x 1080.
 

787
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,310
settings, I'm going to go 1920 x 1080.
I'm going to do a uh p I'm going to tell

788
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:20,320
I'm going to do a uh p I'm going to tell
 

789
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,069
I'm going to do a uh p I'm going to tell
it to do a PNG sequence, and then I'll

790
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:22,079
it to do a PNG sequence, and then I'll
 

791
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,829
it to do a PNG sequence, and then I'll
sequence that together. If you don't

792
00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:23,839
sequence that together. If you don't
 

793
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,189
sequence that together. If you don't
want to do a PNG sequence and you just

794
00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:25,199
want to do a PNG sequence and you just
 

795
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,430
want to do a PNG sequence and you just
want Blender to give you MP4 out the

796
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:27,440
want Blender to give you MP4 out the
 

797
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,949
want Blender to give you MP4 out the
box, which I don't encourage, but you

798
00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:28,959
box, which I don't encourage, but you
 

799
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,269
box, which I don't encourage, but you
totally can. Um, we can go here to a

00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:31,279
totally can. Um, we can go here to a
