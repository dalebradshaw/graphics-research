00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,149

Clutter can be your absolute worst

2
00:00:02,149 --> 00:00:02,159
Clutter can be your absolute worst
 

3
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,070
Clutter can be your absolute worst
nightmare when it comes to making really

4
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:04,080
nightmare when it comes to making really
 

5
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,829
nightmare when it comes to making really
good-looking renders. Clutter doesn't

6
00:00:05,829 --> 00:00:05,839
good-looking renders. Clutter doesn't
 

7
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,510
good-looking renders. Clutter doesn't
always have to mean something bad. Quite

8
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:07,520
always have to mean something bad. Quite
 

9
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,589
always have to mean something bad. Quite
often, the clutter is a mix of really

10
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:09,599
often, the clutter is a mix of really
 

11
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,990
often, the clutter is a mix of really
cool details that I want in my design.

12
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:12,000
cool details that I want in my design.
 

13
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,589
cool details that I want in my design.
But sometimes you need to figure out how

14
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:13,599
But sometimes you need to figure out how
 

15
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,669
But sometimes you need to figure out how
to make sense of all the clutter. You

16
00:00:15,669 --> 00:00:15,679
to make sense of all the clutter. You
 

17
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,670
to make sense of all the clutter. You
can do that by learning a system of

18
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:17,680
can do that by learning a system of
 

19
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,230
can do that by learning a system of
visual hierarchy. Sometimes you're not

20
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:20,240
visual hierarchy. Sometimes you're not
 

21
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,310
visual hierarchy. Sometimes you're not
putting the wrong details in your image.

22
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:22,320
putting the wrong details in your image.
 

23
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,310
putting the wrong details in your image.
They're just not organized in the best

24
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:24,320
They're just not organized in the best
 

25
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,790
They're just not organized in the best
way. and using a simple system of visual

26
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:26,800
way. and using a simple system of visual
 

27
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,230
way. and using a simple system of visual
hierarchy that can take a really

28
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:28,240
hierarchy that can take a really
 

29
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,230
hierarchy that can take a really
visually cluttered image and turn it

30
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:30,240
visually cluttered image and turn it
 

31
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,950
visually cluttered image and turn it
into a beautiful balanced image. So

32
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:32,960
into a beautiful balanced image. So
 

33
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,630
into a beautiful balanced image. So
today I want to show you a really cool

34
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:34,640
today I want to show you a really cool
 

35
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,790
today I want to show you a really cool
system of visual hierarchy and I'll show

36
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:36,800
system of visual hierarchy and I'll show
 

37
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,310
system of visual hierarchy and I'll show
you how I used it in a set of animations

38
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:38,320
you how I used it in a set of animations
 

39
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,709
you how I used it in a set of animations
that I created this week. So let's start

40
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:40,719
that I created this week. So let's start
 

41
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,030
that I created this week. So let's start
with what this visual hierarchy system

42
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:43,040
with what this visual hierarchy system
 

43
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,510
with what this visual hierarchy system
is. You need to take all the details

44
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:45,520
is. You need to take all the details
 

45
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,190
is. You need to take all the details
that you are going to put in your image

46
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:47,200
that you are going to put in your image
 

47
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,950
that you are going to put in your image
and divide them up into primary,

48
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:48,960
and divide them up into primary,
 

49
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,270
and divide them up into primary,
secondary, and tertiary details. Once

50
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:51,280
secondary, and tertiary details. Once
 

51
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,790
secondary, and tertiary details. Once
you're able to figure that out, you can

52
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:52,800
you're able to figure that out, you can
 

53
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,389
you're able to figure that out, you can
start to implement them and make really

54
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:54,399
start to implement them and make really
 

55
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,069
start to implement them and make really
balanced images. Here's what I mean.

56
00:00:56,069 --> 00:00:56,079
balanced images. Here's what I mean.
 

57
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,229
balanced images. Here's what I mean.
Look at these two images. Both look

58
00:00:58,229 --> 00:00:58,239
Look at these two images. Both look
 

59
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:59,990
Look at these two images. Both look
really, really cool, but one of them

60
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:00,000
really, really cool, but one of them
 

61
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,750
really, really cool, but one of them
just feels a little bit more balanced

62
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:01,760
just feels a little bit more balanced
 

63
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,270
just feels a little bit more balanced
and a little bit more pleasing to look

64
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:03,280
and a little bit more pleasing to look
 

65
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,350
and a little bit more pleasing to look
at. The one on the right has a lot of

66
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:05,360
at. The one on the right has a lot of
 

67
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,510
at. The one on the right has a lot of
really cool details, but the focal point

68
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:07,520
really cool details, but the focal point
 

69
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,350
really cool details, but the focal point
in the middle is just as visually

70
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:09,360
in the middle is just as visually
 

71
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,750
in the middle is just as visually
cluttered as the space around it, making

72
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:11,760
cluttered as the space around it, making
 

73
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,910
cluttered as the space around it, making
it feel really busy with no space to

74
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:13,920
it feel really busy with no space to
 

75
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,750
it feel really busy with no space to
give your eyes a break. Now, the image

76
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:15,760
give your eyes a break. Now, the image
 

77
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,230
give your eyes a break. Now, the image
on the right is just as detailed, but as

78
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:18,240
on the right is just as detailed, but as
 

79
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,390
on the right is just as detailed, but as
you can see, the details and the shapes

80
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:20,400
you can see, the details and the shapes
 

81
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,310
you can see, the details and the shapes
feel a little bit more intentional. You

82
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:22,320
feel a little bit more intentional. You
 

83
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,990
feel a little bit more intentional. You
can see we have this one large shape in

84
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:24,000
can see we have this one large shape in
 

85
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,230
can see we have this one large shape in
the middle, quite a few medium-sized

86
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:26,240
the middle, quite a few medium-sized
 

87
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,830
the middle, quite a few medium-sized
shapes that kind of give your eyes a

88
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:27,840
shapes that kind of give your eyes a
 

89
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,830
shapes that kind of give your eyes a
break from the busyiness, and then you

90
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:29,840
break from the busyiness, and then you
 

91
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,590
break from the busyiness, and then you
have all those really, really small

92
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:31,600
have all those really, really small
 

93
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,749
have all those really, really small
details scattered around the image as

94
00:01:33,749 --> 00:01:33,759
details scattered around the image as
 

95
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,510
details scattered around the image as
well. One thing to look at in this

96
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:35,520
well. One thing to look at in this
 

97
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,429
well. One thing to look at in this
render and this render that I made is

98
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:37,439
render and this render that I made is
 

99
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,749
render and this render that I made is
there is a good chunk of space dedicated

100
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:39,759
there is a good chunk of space dedicated
 

101
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,789
there is a good chunk of space dedicated
to large objects that give your eyes a

102
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:42,799
to large objects that give your eyes a
 

103
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,270
to large objects that give your eyes a
place to rest. Really busy, cluttered

104
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:45,280
place to rest. Really busy, cluttered
 

105
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,429
place to rest. Really busy, cluttered
images can be really cool, but after a

106
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:47,439
images can be really cool, but after a
 

107
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,030
images can be really cool, but after a
while, they have a strain on your eyes,

108
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:49,040
while, they have a strain on your eyes,
 

109
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,630
while, they have a strain on your eyes,
and having a place for them to rest with

110
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:50,640
and having a place for them to rest with
 

111
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,630
and having a place for them to rest with
larger and medium-sized objects can help

112
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:52,640
larger and medium-sized objects can help
 

113
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,270
larger and medium-sized objects can help
you appreciate the smaller details. Now,

114
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:55,280
you appreciate the smaller details. Now,
 

115
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,270
you appreciate the smaller details. Now,
how can you implement the system in your

116
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:57,280
how can you implement the system in your
 

117
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,950
how can you implement the system in your
own renders? Let's look at a couple of

118
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:58,960
own renders? Let's look at a couple of
 

119
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,469
own renders? Let's look at a couple of
these renders that I just taught on

120
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:00,479
these renders that I just taught on
 

121
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,310
these renders that I just taught on
Patreon and show you how I implemented

122
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:02,320
Patreon and show you how I implemented
 

123
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,789
Patreon and show you how I implemented
these ideas in these because there is a

124
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:04,799
these ideas in these because there is a
 

125
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,389
these ideas in these because there is a
lot of details that I had to put in

126
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:06,399
lot of details that I had to put in
 

127
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,150
lot of details that I had to put in
them. This render here is actually a

128
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:08,160
them. This render here is actually a
 

129
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,550
them. This render here is actually a
good lesson in applying the system, but

130
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:10,560
good lesson in applying the system, but
 

131
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,790
good lesson in applying the system, but
with really, really simple use cases.

132
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:12,800
with really, really simple use cases.
 

133
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,390
with really, really simple use cases.
Sometimes to get a really well- balanced

134
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:14,400
Sometimes to get a really well- balanced
 

135
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,790
Sometimes to get a really well- balanced
scene, you just need to start simple,

136
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:16,800
scene, you just need to start simple,
 

137
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,710
scene, you just need to start simple,
just with some simple shapes. So, start

138
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:18,720
just with some simple shapes. So, start
 

139
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,949
just with some simple shapes. So, start
with your main idea. In this case, it's

140
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:20,959
with your main idea. In this case, it's
 

141
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,869
with your main idea. In this case, it's
going to be particles that take the

142
00:02:22,869 --> 00:02:22,879
going to be particles that take the
 

143
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,750
going to be particles that take the
shape of a system of hexagons. Once you

144
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:25,760
shape of a system of hexagons. Once you
 

145
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,350
shape of a system of hexagons. Once you
have that idea, in this case, the

146
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:27,360
have that idea, in this case, the
 

147
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,270
have that idea, in this case, the
hexagons established, you can look at

148
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:29,280
hexagons established, you can look at
 

149
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,830
hexagons established, you can look at
your scene and try to feel out what is

150
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:31,840
your scene and try to feel out what is
 

151
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,910
your scene and try to feel out what is
missing. Here I decided if I just

152
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:33,920
missing. Here I decided if I just
 

153
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,390
missing. Here I decided if I just
duplicate the system, lower it down so

154
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:36,400
duplicate the system, lower it down so
 

155
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,630
duplicate the system, lower it down so
that you have a lot more details below

156
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:38,640
that you have a lot more details below
 

157
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,110
that you have a lot more details below
the main focal point and then so that

158
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:41,120
the main focal point and then so that
 

159
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,110
the main focal point and then so that
they don't draw so much attention, I

160
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:43,120
they don't draw so much attention, I
 

161
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,430
they don't draw so much attention, I
made the object smaller and the material

162
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:45,440
made the object smaller and the material
 

163
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,350
made the object smaller and the material
a little bit darker. So we still can

164
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:47,360
a little bit darker. So we still can
 

165
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,350
a little bit darker. So we still can
look at that main layer up top, but it

166
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:49,360
look at that main layer up top, but it
 

167
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,910
look at that main layer up top, but it
does show a much more full scene that

168
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:51,920
does show a much more full scene that
 

169
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,150
does show a much more full scene that
solidifies that hexagonal pattern even

170
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,160
solidifies that hexagonal pattern even
 

171
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,309
solidifies that hexagonal pattern even
more, but in a more subtle way. And then

172
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:56,319
more, but in a more subtle way. And then
 

173
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,830
more, but in a more subtle way. And then
I felt like it needed a little bit more

174
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:57,840
I felt like it needed a little bit more
 

175
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,190
I felt like it needed a little bit more
fun in the lighting. So, I added some

176
00:02:59,190 --> 00:02:59,200
fun in the lighting. So, I added some
 

177
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,350
fun in the lighting. So, I added some
volume, added a light, and the scene

178
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:01,360
volume, added a light, and the scene
 

179
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,350
volume, added a light, and the scene
really felt completed at that point.

180
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:03,360
really felt completed at that point.
 

181
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,270
really felt completed at that point.
It's a very, very simple scene. So,

182
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:05,280
It's a very, very simple scene. So,
 

183
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,830
It's a very, very simple scene. So,
applying visual hierarchy, large object,

184
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:07,840
applying visual hierarchy, large object,
 

185
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,070
applying visual hierarchy, large object,
small object, sometimes doesn't need to

186
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:10,080
small object, sometimes doesn't need to
 

187
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,830
small object, sometimes doesn't need to
be that complicated. Now, this render

188
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:11,840
be that complicated. Now, this render
 

189
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,830
be that complicated. Now, this render
right here is a great example of having

190
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:13,840
right here is a great example of having
 

191
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,910
right here is a great example of having
a lot of detail in it, but we're going

192
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:15,920
a lot of detail in it, but we're going
 

193
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,190
a lot of detail in it, but we're going
to learn how to make sense of it and

194
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:17,200
to learn how to make sense of it and
 

195
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,190
to learn how to make sense of it and
make a really cool image. So, like I

196
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,200
make a really cool image. So, like I
 

197
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,949
make a really cool image. So, like I
said, in this image, I started with the

198
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:20,959
said, in this image, I started with the
 

199
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,030
said, in this image, I started with the
big objects, the medium objects, and

200
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,040
big objects, the medium objects, and
 

201
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,190
big objects, the medium objects, and
then all of the small details to finish

202
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,200
then all of the small details to finish
 

203
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,110
then all of the small details to finish
it out. Now, it could still look cool if

204
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,120
it out. Now, it could still look cool if
 

205
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,110
it out. Now, it could still look cool if
we just want to have large details and

206
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,120
we just want to have large details and
 

207
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,270
we just want to have large details and
small details, or we can just do medium

208
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:31,280
small details, or we can just do medium
 

209
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,670
small details, or we can just do medium
details and small details. Both don't

210
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:33,680
details and small details. Both don't
 

211
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,990
details and small details. Both don't
entirely look that bad, but I personally

212
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,000
entirely look that bad, but I personally
 

213
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,830
entirely look that bad, but I personally
think having a well- balanced system of

214
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:37,840
think having a well- balanced system of
 

215
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,149
think having a well- balanced system of
all of those details makes this image

216
00:03:40,149 --> 00:03:40,159
all of those details makes this image
 

217
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,390
all of those details makes this image
look really cool. So, to make this, I

218
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:42,400
look really cool. So, to make this, I
 

219
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,869
look really cool. So, to make this, I
started in geometry nodes and modeled

220
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:44,879
started in geometry nodes and modeled
 

221
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,030
started in geometry nodes and modeled
the big blocks. Once I had those figured

222
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,040
the big blocks. Once I had those figured
 

223
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,630
the big blocks. Once I had those figured
out, I was able to give them a little

224
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:48,640
out, I was able to give them a little
 

225
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,550
out, I was able to give them a little
bit of wireframe detail. And then I

226
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:50,560
bit of wireframe detail. And then I
 

227
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,470
bit of wireframe detail. And then I
immediately went into adding a solid

228
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:52,480
immediately went into adding a solid
 

229
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,869
immediately went into adding a solid
reflective floor. After that, it made

230
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:54,879
reflective floor. After that, it made
 

231
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,789
reflective floor. After that, it made
sense to add a little bit of roughness

232
00:03:56,789 --> 00:03:56,799
sense to add a little bit of roughness
 

233
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,110
sense to add a little bit of roughness
detail to the metallic surface that's

234
00:03:59,110 --> 00:03:59,120
detail to the metallic surface that's
 

235
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,630
detail to the metallic surface that's
able to let the light interact with it

236
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:00,640
able to let the light interact with it
 

237
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,470
able to let the light interact with it
and really influence my decisions after

238
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:02,480
and really influence my decisions after
 

239
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,070
and really influence my decisions after
that. But if I like the floor and the

240
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,080
that. But if I like the floor and the
 

241
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,830
that. But if I like the floor and the
blocks, they still needed a lot more

242
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:05,840
blocks, they still needed a lot more
 

243
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,630
blocks, they still needed a lot more
detail to make the scene feel large. So

244
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:08,640
detail to make the scene feel large. So
 

245
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,789
detail to make the scene feel large. So
on all of the blocks, they got a subtle

246
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:10,799
on all of the blocks, they got a subtle
 

247
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,750
on all of the blocks, they got a subtle
voronoi detail in them. And with a tree

248
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:13,760
voronoi detail in them. And with a tree
 

249
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,390
voronoi detail in them. And with a tree
of wave textures and vorinoi, I was able

250
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:16,400
of wave textures and vorinoi, I was able
 

251
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,030
of wave textures and vorinoi, I was able
to add tons of small detail in the color

252
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,040
to add tons of small detail in the color
 

253
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,430
to add tons of small detail in the color
and the brightness of the floor, making

254
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:21,440
and the brightness of the floor, making
 

255
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,670
and the brightness of the floor, making
this really, really cool looking scene.

256
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:23,680
this really, really cool looking scene.
 

257
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,070
this really, really cool looking scene.
At this point, I had a good variety of

258
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:26,080
At this point, I had a good variety of
 

259
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,469
At this point, I had a good variety of
big details and small details, but to

260
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:28,479
big details and small details, but to
 

261
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,310
big details and small details, but to
balance it out, I was able to add some

262
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:30,320
balance it out, I was able to add some
 

263
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,390
balance it out, I was able to add some
smaller blocks, and immediately it felt

264
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:32,400
smaller blocks, and immediately it felt
 

265
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,150
smaller blocks, and immediately it felt
so much more balanced. Last thing I

266
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:34,160
so much more balanced. Last thing I
 

267
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,390
so much more balanced. Last thing I
added was some small emission and bump

268
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:36,400
added was some small emission and bump
 

269
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,150
added was some small emission and bump
details to the blocks, and it was

270
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:38,160
details to the blocks, and it was
 

271
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,070
details to the blocks, and it was
totally done. One thing you'll start to

272
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,080
totally done. One thing you'll start to
 

273
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,749
totally done. One thing you'll start to
learn as you get better at making images

274
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:41,759
learn as you get better at making images
 

275
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,749
learn as you get better at making images
is being able to look at your scene and

276
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:43,759
is being able to look at your scene and
 

277
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,030
is being able to look at your scene and
feel there's definitely something

278
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,040
feel there's definitely something
 

279
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,430
feel there's definitely something
missing here. But learning how to go

280
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:47,440
missing here. But learning how to go
 

281
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,510
missing here. But learning how to go
through that and answer that question

282
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:49,520
through that and answer that question
 

283
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,110
through that and answer that question
will really help you be more efficient

284
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,120
will really help you be more efficient
 

285
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,950
will really help you be more efficient
in making really beautiful images. Now,

286
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:52,960
in making really beautiful images. Now,
 

287
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,070
in making really beautiful images. Now,
I want to lightening round a few of

288
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,080
I want to lightening round a few of
 

289
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,590
I want to lightening round a few of
these renders and talk about these as

290
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:55,600
these renders and talk about these as
 

291
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,909
these renders and talk about these as
well. The initial idea was to make this

292
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:57,919
well. The initial idea was to make this
 

293
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,230
well. The initial idea was to make this
hologram style looking city in this

294
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:00,240
hologram style looking city in this
 

295
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,870
hologram style looking city in this
animation, but at this point it just

296
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:02,880
animation, but at this point it just
 

297
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,950
animation, but at this point it just
felt really cluttered. I didn't entirely

298
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:04,960
felt really cluttered. I didn't entirely
 

299
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,749
felt really cluttered. I didn't entirely
know what to do and I landed on using a

300
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:07,759
know what to do and I landed on using a
 

301
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,790
know what to do and I landed on using a
voronoid pattern to cut lots of gaps in

302
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:10,800
voronoid pattern to cut lots of gaps in
 

303
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,629
voronoid pattern to cut lots of gaps in
the city and actually makes it look a

304
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:12,639
the city and actually makes it look a
 

305
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,310
the city and actually makes it look a
little bit more interesting. Gives the

306
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:14,320
little bit more interesting. Gives the
 

307
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,070
little bit more interesting. Gives the
scene some room to breathe. And I was

308
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,080
scene some room to breathe. And I was
 

309
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,950
scene some room to breathe. And I was
able to add some smaller dot details and

310
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:18,960
able to add some smaller dot details and
 

311
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,710
able to add some smaller dot details and
some other things in there to make the

312
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:20,720
some other things in there to make the
 

313
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,550
some other things in there to make the
scene feel really nice and and broke up

314
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:22,560
scene feel really nice and and broke up
 

315
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,749
scene feel really nice and and broke up
that scene that kind of looked like an

316
00:05:23,749 --> 00:05:23,759
that scene that kind of looked like an
 

317
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,230
that scene that kind of looked like an
aerial view of New York and just made it

318
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:26,240

319
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,670
aerial view of New York and just made it
feel a little bit more balanced and

320
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:27,680
feel a little bit more balanced and
 

321
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,350
feel a little bit more balanced and
breathable. The point of this scene was

322
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:29,360
breathable. The point of this scene was
 

323
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,430
breathable. The point of this scene was
to teach how to use curves and make them

324
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:31,440
to teach how to use curves and make them
 

325
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,870
to teach how to use curves and make them
kind of look a little bit more sci-fi

326
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:32,880
kind of look a little bit more sci-fi
 

327
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,670
kind of look a little bit more sci-fi
and use voroi to manipulate them. But I

328
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:35,680
and use voroi to manipulate them. But I
 

329
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,510
and use voroi to manipulate them. But I
wanted the scene to look really nice and

330
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:37,520
wanted the scene to look really nice and
 

331
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,270
wanted the scene to look really nice and
balanced. So I started with the small

332
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:39,280
balanced. So I started with the small
 

333
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,270
balanced. So I started with the small
curves and made a lot of them, broke

334
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:41,280
curves and made a lot of them, broke
 

335
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,870
curves and made a lot of them, broke
them up a little bit and added some

336
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:42,880
them up a little bit and added some
 

337
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,790
them up a little bit and added some
light to them. And then I added a few

338
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:44,800
light to them. And then I added a few
 

339
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,590
light to them. And then I added a few
details on the floor with that square

340
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:47,600
details on the floor with that square
 

341
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,230
details on the floor with that square
looking voronoi pattern. But to me there

342
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:50,240
looking voronoi pattern. But to me there
 

343
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,390
looking voronoi pattern. But to me there
was something missing. And the answer to

344
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:52,400
was something missing. And the answer to
 

345
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,189
was something missing. And the answer to
that was a very large set of curves as

346
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:55,199
that was a very large set of curves as
 

347
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,430
that was a very large set of curves as
well on top of them to really balance

348
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,440
well on top of them to really balance
 

349
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,029
well on top of them to really balance
out this scene and make it look really

350
00:05:59,029 --> 00:05:59,039

351
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,430
