00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,270

How's it going, guys? So, in this

2
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:01,280
How's it going, guys? So, in this
 

3
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,710
How's it going, guys? So, in this
tutorial, we're going to be making this

4
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:02,720
tutorial, we're going to be making this
 

5
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,390
tutorial, we're going to be making this
render right here. First thing we're

6
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:04,400
render right here. First thing we're
 

7
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,910
render right here. First thing we're
going to do is hop into geometry nodes

8
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:05,920
going to do is hop into geometry nodes
 

9
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,230
going to do is hop into geometry nodes
and model the larger objects. Then,

10
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:08,240
and model the larger objects. Then,
 

11
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,509
and model the larger objects. Then,
we're going to use the same procedure

12
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:09,519
we're going to use the same procedure
 

13
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,669
we're going to use the same procedure
and make the smaller objects. And for

14
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:11,679
and make the smaller objects. And for
 

15
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,030
and make the smaller objects. And for
the first time on this channel, I'm

16
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:13,040
the first time on this channel, I'm
 

17
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,230
the first time on this channel, I'm
going to show you guys how to create

18
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:14,240
going to show you guys how to create
 

19
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,630
going to show you guys how to create
booleans directly within geometry nodes

20
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:16,640
booleans directly within geometry nodes
 

21
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,310
booleans directly within geometry nodes
to clean up that whole system. This

22
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:18,320
to clean up that whole system. This
 

23
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,910
to clean up that whole system. This
animation was inspired by Tron. So,

24
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:19,920
animation was inspired by Tron. So,
 

25
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,109
animation was inspired by Tron. So,
we're going to be doing a little bit of

26
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:21,119
we're going to be doing a little bit of
 

27
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,349
we're going to be doing a little bit of
wireframing to get that Tron inspired

28
00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:23,359
wireframing to get that Tron inspired
 

29
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,710
wireframing to get that Tron inspired
look. Then after that, we're going to

30
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:24,720
look. Then after that, we're going to
 

31
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,470
look. Then after that, we're going to
hop into the shader editor and work on

32
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:26,480
hop into the shader editor and work on
 

33
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,710
hop into the shader editor and work on
detailing the metallic material on all

34
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:28,720
detailing the metallic material on all
 

35
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,109
detailing the metallic material on all
of those objects. Then my favorite part,

36
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:31,119
of those objects. Then my favorite part,
 

37
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,069
of those objects. Then my favorite part,
we're going to make a procedural

38
00:00:32,069 --> 00:00:32,079
we're going to make a procedural
 

39
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,229
we're going to make a procedural
material on the floor to create that

40
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:34,239
material on the floor to create that
 

41
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,150
material on the floor to create that
really, really cool pattern. Then we're

42
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:36,160
really, really cool pattern. Then we're
 

43
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,350
really, really cool pattern. Then we're
going to bring it all together and

44
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:37,360
going to bring it all together and
 

45
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,229
going to bring it all together and
render out a really cool looking sci-fi

46
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:40,239
render out a really cool looking sci-fi
 

47
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,150
render out a really cool looking sci-fi

that being said, let's hop into this

70
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:01,760
that being said, let's hop into this
 

71
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,189
that being said, let's hop into this
tutorial. All right, first we're going

72
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:03,199
tutorial. All right, first we're going
 

73
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:04,869
tutorial. All right, first we're going
to get the modeling portion out of the

74
00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:04,879
to get the modeling portion out of the
 

75
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,149
to get the modeling portion out of the
way. So, what I'm going to do is just

76
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:06,159
way. So, what I'm going to do is just
 

77
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,149
way. So, what I'm going to do is just
hit shift A. We're going to get a plane

78
00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:08,159
hit shift A. We're going to get a plane
 

79
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,990
hit shift A. We're going to get a plane
and I'm going to bring over just a brand

80
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:10,000
and I'm going to bring over just a brand
 

81
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,390
and I'm going to bring over just a brand
new window and make that my geometry

82
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:12,400
new window and make that my geometry
 

83
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,750
new window and make that my geometry
nodes editor. We're going to click new

84
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:13,760
nodes editor. We're going to click new
 

85
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,950
nodes editor. We're going to click new
and as always, we're going to delete the

86
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:14,960
and as always, we're going to delete the
 

87
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,469
and as always, we're going to delete the
input and we're going to start out with

88
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:16,479
input and we're going to start out with
 

89
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,710
input and we're going to start out with
a

90
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:18,720
a
 

91
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,310
a
grid

92
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:20,320
grid
 

93
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,390
grid
right here. It's over here. Let's make

94
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:22,400
right here. It's over here. Let's make
 

95
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,109
right here. It's over here. Let's make
it 10 by 10. And let's go ahead and

96
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:25,119
it 10 by 10. And let's go ahead and
 

97
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,429
it 10 by 10. And let's go ahead and
distribute. We're going to hit shift a

98
00:01:27,429 --> 00:01:27,439
distribute. We're going to hit shift a
 

99
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,070
distribute. We're going to hit shift a
search distribute points on faces just

100
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:30,080
search distribute points on faces just
 

101
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,670
search distribute points on faces just
like this. And we're right now we're

102
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:31,680
like this. And we're right now we're
 

103
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,749
like this. And we're right now we're
going to model the big shapes. So we're

104
00:01:33,749 --> 00:01:33,759
going to model the big shapes. So we're
 

105
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,630
going to model the big shapes. So we're
going to get the density at point 2 for

106
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:36,640
going to get the density at point 2 for
 

107
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,510
going to get the density at point 2 for
now. And we'll see uh how we feel later.

108
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:39,520
now. And we'll see uh how we feel later.
 

109
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,870
now. And we'll see uh how we feel later.
And let's get a instance on points node.

110
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:42,880
And let's get a instance on points node.
 

111
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,510
And let's get a instance on points node.
And of course we need to instance some

112
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:45,520
And of course we need to instance some
 

113
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,630
And of course we need to instance some
cubes. So let's plug him right into

114
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:48,640
cubes. So let's plug him right into
 

115
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,350
cubes. So let's plug him right into
instance. And now we have uh a random

116
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:51,360
instance. And now we have uh a random
 

117
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,030
instance. And now we have uh a random
distribution. Now to make this really

118
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,040
distribution. Now to make this really
 

119
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,910
distribution. Now to make this really
cool sci-fi, we need to go ahead and get

120
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:55,920
cool sci-fi, we need to go ahead and get
 

121
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,149
cool sci-fi, we need to go ahead and get
in a random value set to vector. The

122
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:00,159
in a random value set to vector. The
 

123
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,510
in a random value set to vector. The
reason why I want to do vector is

124
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:01,520
reason why I want to do vector is
 

125
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,350
reason why I want to do vector is
because we want to randomize X, Y, and Z

126
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:05,360
because we want to randomize X, Y, and Z
 

127
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,630
because we want to randomize X, Y, and Z
of all of these cubes, not just a

128
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:08,640
of all of these cubes, not just a
 

129
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,229
of all of these cubes, not just a
minimum and a maximum. So that would

130
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:10,239
minimum and a maximum. So that would
 

131
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,630
minimum and a maximum. So that would
keep essentially them what would be the

132
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:12,640
keep essentially them what would be the
 

133
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,949
keep essentially them what would be the
term uniform. In this case, if we do

134
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:14,959
term uniform. In this case, if we do
 

135
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,710
term uniform. In this case, if we do
vector, it's actually going to randomize

136
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:16,720
vector, it's actually going to randomize
 

137
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,949
vector, it's actually going to randomize
all options X, Y, and Z, which is really

138
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:18,959
all options X, Y, and Z, which is really
 

139
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,350
all options X, Y, and Z, which is really
cool. And what we're looking for. So on

140
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:21,360
cool. And what we're looking for. So on
 

141
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,470
cool. And what we're looking for. So on
these, we're just going to give them a

142
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:22,480
these, we're just going to give them a
 

143
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,150
these, we're just going to give them a
scale of two. And then here, my exact

144
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,160
scale of two. And then here, my exact
 

145
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,150
scale of two. And then here, my exact
settings were 4.4

146
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,160

 

147
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,910

two.

148
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:31,920
two.
 

149
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,750
two.
And then make them really short.

150
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:33,760
And then make them really short.
 

151
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,390
And then make them really short.
Something like this. And then maybe

152
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:36,400
Something like this. And then maybe
 

153
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,390
Something like this. And then maybe
bring him down as well. We want them to

154
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:38,400
bring him down as well. We want them to
 

155
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,710
bring him down as well. We want them to
be pretty short. We can edit how tall

156
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:40,720
be pretty short. We can edit how tall
 

157
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,070
be pretty short. We can edit how tall
they are a bit later, but right now

158
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,080
they are a bit later, but right now
 

159
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,830
they are a bit later, but right now
we're just focusing on large objects

160
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:45,840
we're just focusing on large objects
 

161
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,470
we're just focusing on large objects
here, the big pieces of the scene. So

162
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:48,480
here, the big pieces of the scene. So
 

163
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,070
here, the big pieces of the scene. So
now we have this and then there is a

164
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,080
now we have this and then there is a
 

165
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,190
now we have this and then there is a
seed value if you want something else.

166
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:53,200
seed value if you want something else.
 

167
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,750
seed value if you want something else.
And actually I think I saw something I

168
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:55,760
And actually I think I saw something I
 

169
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,270
And actually I think I saw something I
like

170
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:57,280
like
 

171
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,430
like
h I don't know

172
00:02:59,430 --> 00:02:59,440
h I don't know
 

173
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,990
h I don't know
maybe bring the density down.

174
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,000
maybe bring the density down.
 

175
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,990
maybe bring the density down.
Yeah, this is good. Okay, so I think we

176
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,000
Yeah, this is good. Okay, so I think we
 

177
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,030
Yeah, this is good. Okay, so I think we
can work with this really really well.

178
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,040
can work with this really really well.
 

179
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,509
can work with this really really well.
Now what I want to do is distribute our

180
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:09,519
Now what I want to do is distribute our
 

181
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,270
Now what I want to do is distribute our
smaller pieces throughout the scene as

182
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,280
smaller pieces throughout the scene as
 

183
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,229
smaller pieces throughout the scene as
well. Actually this this is good. So now

184
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:14,239
well. Actually this this is good. So now
 

185
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,309
well. Actually this this is good. So now
what I want to do is get the small

186
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:16,319
what I want to do is get the small
 

187
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,630
what I want to do is get the small
details distributed next. So what we're

188
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:18,640
details distributed next. So what we're
 

189
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,869
details distributed next. So what we're
going to do is get a join geometry.

190
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:22,879
going to do is get a join geometry.
 

191
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,589
going to do is get a join geometry.
Same grid. We're going to get a

192
00:03:25,589 --> 00:03:25,599
Same grid. We're going to get a
 

193
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,670
Same grid. We're going to get a
distribute points on faces and we'll

194
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:27,680
distribute points on faces and we'll
 

195
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,390
distribute points on faces and we'll
just plug that right into here. Now we

196
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:30,400
just plug that right into here. Now we
 

197
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,550
just plug that right into here. Now we
have a bunch of new points that we can

198
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:32,560
have a bunch of new points that we can
 

199
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,270
have a bunch of new points that we can
put another instance on points.

200
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:35,280
put another instance on points.
 

201
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,229
put another instance on points.
We'll just use the same cube. No need in

202
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:38,239
We'll just use the same cube. No need in
 

203
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,710
We'll just use the same cube. No need in
getting a brand new one.

204
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:40,720
getting a brand new one.
 

205
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,229
getting a brand new one.
Let's bring that density down to

206
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:42,239
Let's bring that density down to
 

207
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,309
Let's bring that density down to
something like

208
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:44,319
something like
 

209
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:50,630
something like
two. And we'll get another random value.

210
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:50,640

 

211
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,550

Set that to vector. And we'll go right

212
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:52,560
Set that to vector. And we'll go right
 

213
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,910
Set that to vector. And we'll go right
here into the scale. So right now

214
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:55,920
here into the scale. So right now
 

215
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,270
here into the scale. So right now
I'm just going to give them both a value

216
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:57,280
I'm just going to give them both a value
 

217
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,149
I'm just going to give them both a value
of one and just scale them down till I

218
00:04:00,149 --> 00:04:00,159
of one and just scale them down till I
 

219
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,030
of one and just scale them down till I
like their kind of general size. And

220
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,040
like their kind of general size. And
 

221
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,710
like their kind of general size. And
then

222
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:04,720
then
 

223
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,030
then
we can make them small.

224
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,040
we can make them small.
 

225
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,350
we can make them small.
Stretch them out.

226
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:11,360
Stretch them out.
 

227
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,670
Stretch them out.
Something like that. Okay. So, these are

228
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:13,680
Something like that. Okay. So, these are
 

229
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,590
Something like that. Okay. So, these are
my exact settings for these small ones.

230
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:17,600
my exact settings for these small ones.
 

231
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,509
my exact settings for these small ones.
This is my exact settings for the large

232
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:19,519
This is my exact settings for the large
 

233
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,830
This is my exact settings for the large
ones. If we look at the wireframe now,

234
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:21,840
ones. If we look at the wireframe now,
 

235
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,590
ones. If we look at the wireframe now,
you'll notice everything is

236
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:23,600
you'll notice everything is
 

237
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,749
you'll notice everything is
intersecting. You can see there's a lot

238
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:25,759
intersecting. You can see there's a lot
 

239
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,510
intersecting. You can see there's a lot
of objects within the big objects. And

240
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:27,520
of objects within the big objects. And
 

241
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,189
of objects within the big objects. And
when it comes to wireframing them, it

242
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:29,199
when it comes to wireframing them, it
 

243
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,590
when it comes to wireframing them, it
will definitely highlight the fact that

244
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:31,600
will definitely highlight the fact that
 

245
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,830
will definitely highlight the fact that
objects are going inside of other

246
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:33,840
objects are going inside of other
 

247
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,390
objects are going inside of other
objects. That might not be preferable to

248
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:36,400
objects. That might not be preferable to
 

249
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,749
objects. That might not be preferable to
you. It's definitely not pref It's

250
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:37,759
you. It's definitely not pref It's
 

251
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,510
you. It's definitely not pref It's
definitely not preferable to me. So,

252
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:39,520
definitely not preferable to me. So,
 

253
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,350
definitely not preferable to me. So,
what we need to do is get a mesh boolean

254
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,360
what we need to do is get a mesh boolean
 

255
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,950
what we need to do is get a mesh boolean
right here. And I'm going to switch it

256
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:44,960
right here. And I'm going to switch it
 

257
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,870
right here. And I'm going to switch it
to union. Let me go back to wireframe.

258
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:46,880
to union. Let me go back to wireframe.
 

259
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,390
to union. Let me go back to wireframe.
And we can watch what happens,

260
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:48,400
And we can watch what happens,
 

261
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,070
And we can watch what happens,
especially in these bigger chunks. If we

262
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,080
especially in these bigger chunks. If we
 

263
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,070
especially in these bigger chunks. If we
just put it right here and there we go.

264
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,080
just put it right here and there we go.
 

265
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,189
just put it right here and there we go.
We now have mesh booleans going

266
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:55,199
We now have mesh booleans going
 

267
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,710
We now have mesh booleans going
everywhere in the scene. and it looks

268
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:56,720
everywhere in the scene. and it looks
 

269
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,790
everywhere in the scene. and it looks
really really cool. So then what's going

270
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:58,800
really really cool. So then what's going
 

271
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,670
really really cool. So then what's going
to happen is when we go to the

272
00:04:59,670 --> 00:04:59,680
to happen is when we go to the
 

273
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,030
to happen is when we go to the
wireframe, the wireframe is actually

274
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:01,040
wireframe, the wireframe is actually
 

275
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,510
wireframe, the wireframe is actually
going to highlight that these objects

276
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:03,520
going to highlight that these objects
 

277
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,590
going to highlight that these objects
stop here rather than you can see

278
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:05,600
stop here rather than you can see
 

279
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,830
stop here rather than you can see
wireframes going inside of the object.

280
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:07,840
wireframes going inside of the object.
 

281
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,430
wireframes going inside of the object.
And it's really just not very

282
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:09,440
And it's really just not very
 

283
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,189
And it's really just not very
good-looking. If you want to be able to

284
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:11,199
good-looking. If you want to be able to
 

285
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,870
good-looking. If you want to be able to
view this better, you can hit this drop

286
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:12,880
view this better, you can hit this drop
 

287
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,510
view this better, you can hit this drop
down right here and do a cavity shadow

288
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:15,520
down right here and do a cavity shadow
 

289
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,150
down right here and do a cavity shadow
and outline. And that's going to make uh

290
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,160
and outline. And that's going to make uh
 

291
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,070
and outline. And that's going to make uh
looking at this a little bit e a little

292
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,080
looking at this a little bit e a little
 

293
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,830
looking at this a little bit e a little
bit easier. Next thing we could do is

294
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:21,840
bit easier. Next thing we could do is
 

295
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,629
bit easier. Next thing we could do is
add wireframes to this whole system on

296
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:24,639
add wireframes to this whole system on
 

297
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,550
add wireframes to this whole system on
this distribute points where it says

298
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:26,560
this distribute points where it says
 

299
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,110
this distribute points where it says
4.29.

300
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:29,120
4.29.
 

301
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,590
4.29.
I'm going to get a value node and just

302
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:31,600
I'm going to get a value node and just
 

303
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,189
I'm going to get a value node and just
paste that in there so I can remember

304
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:33,199
paste that in there so I can remember
 

305
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,550
paste that in there so I can remember
it. I'm just going to bring this down to

306
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:34,560
it. I'm just going to bring this down to
 

307
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,430
it. I'm just going to bring this down to
like 0.5 just to lighten up my scene

308
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:37,440
like 0.5 just to lighten up my scene
 

309
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,110
like 0.5 just to lighten up my scene
because it is really really heavy. And I

310
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:39,120
because it is really really heavy. And I
 

311
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,469
because it is really really heavy. And I
want to add some wireframe. I want to

312
00:05:40,469 --> 00:05:40,479
want to add some wireframe. I want to
 

313
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,990
want to add some wireframe. I want to
add materials. And every movement we

314
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,000
add materials. And every movement we
 

315
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,990
add materials. And every movement we
make is going to kind of bog down. So

316
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:44,000
make is going to kind of bog down. So
 

317
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,189
make is going to kind of bog down. So
I'm just going to keep this as a

318
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:45,199
I'm just going to keep this as a
 

319
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,110
I'm just going to keep this as a
reminder. Set this lower and we can move

320
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:47,120
reminder. Set this lower and we can move
 

321
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,029
reminder. Set this lower and we can move
on. So, what I want to do after the mesh

322
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:49,039
on. So, what I want to do after the mesh
 

323
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,430
on. So, what I want to do after the mesh
boolean is get a

324
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:51,440
boolean is get a
 

325
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,909
boolean is get a
mesh to curve

326
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:53,919
mesh to curve
 

327
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,990
mesh to curve
and a

328
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,000
and a
 

329
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,510
and a
curve to mesh node and get a curve

330
00:05:59,510 --> 00:05:59,520
curve to mesh node and get a curve
 

331
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,110
curve to mesh node and get a curve
circle

332
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:01,120
circle
 

333
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,070
circle
there. We're going to give it a

334
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,080
there. We're going to give it a
 

335
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,350
there. We're going to give it a
resolution of six because we aren't

336
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:03,360
resolution of six because we aren't
 

337
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,029
resolution of six because we aren't
really going to see that many. It

338
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:05,039
really going to see that many. It
 

339
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,150
really going to see that many. It
doesn't need to be high poly. And then

340
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:06,160
doesn't need to be high poly. And then
 

341
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,550
doesn't need to be high poly. And then
I'm going to do 01.

342
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:08,560
I'm going to do 01.
 

343
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,870
I'm going to do 01.
Plug that into the profile. And we now

344
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:10,880
Plug that into the profile. And we now
 

345
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,870
Plug that into the profile. And we now
have a wireframe of everything. What I

346
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:12,880
have a wireframe of everything. What I
 

347
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,469
have a wireframe of everything. What I
want to get is a join geometry. And

348
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:16,479
want to get is a join geometry. And
 

349
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,550
want to get is a join geometry. And
right at the mesh boolean, just bring

350
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:18,560
right at the mesh boolean, just bring
 

351
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,189
right at the mesh boolean, just bring
everything back. We now have uh

352
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:21,199
everything back. We now have uh
 

353
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,990
everything back. We now have uh
wireframes on everything. And let's go

354
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,000
wireframes on everything. And let's go
 

355
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,830
wireframes on everything. And let's go
ahead and click on fill caps and bring

356
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:25,840
ahead and click on fill caps and bring
 

357
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,510
ahead and click on fill caps and bring
the radius to like 06, maybe 0.6, just a

358
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:31,520
the radius to like 06, maybe 0.6, just a
 

359
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,550
the radius to like 06, maybe 0.6, just a
smaller wireframe. And we're ready to

360
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:34,560
smaller wireframe. And we're ready to
 

361
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,270
smaller wireframe. And we're ready to
move on. Last thing I want to do here in

362
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:37,280
move on. Last thing I want to do here in
 

363
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,309
move on. Last thing I want to do here in
this grid, just plug that into our join

364
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:40,319
this grid, just plug that into our join
 

365
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,469
this grid, just plug that into our join
geometry. And now we have that floor

366
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:42,479
geometry. And now we have that floor
 

367
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:43,670
geometry. And now we have that floor
portion that we're going to add some

368
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:43,680
portion that we're going to add some
 

369
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,749
portion that we're going to add some
really cool materials to as well. And

370
00:06:45,749 --> 00:06:45,759
really cool materials to as well. And
 

371
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,469
really cool materials to as well. And
we're done with the modeling portion of

372
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:48,479
we're done with the modeling portion of
 

373
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,710
we're done with the modeling portion of
this tutorial. We can go ahead and set

374
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:50,720
this tutorial. We can go ahead and set
 

375
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,670
this tutorial. We can go ahead and set
up materials. So I'm going to get a set

376
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:53,680
up materials. So I'm going to get a set
 

377
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,550
up materials. So I'm going to get a set
material node and put one on each of

378
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:56,560
material node and put one on each of
 

379
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,950
material node and put one on each of
these final lines. This one

380
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:58,960
these final lines. This one
 

381
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,550
these final lines. This one
corresponding with the flat portion. So

382
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:00,560
corresponding with the flat portion. So
 

383
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,950
corresponding with the flat portion. So
let's go to the material portion,

384
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:02,960
let's go to the material portion,
 

385
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,350
let's go to the material portion,
material side. Let's get new and call it

386
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:07,360
material side. Let's get new and call it
 

387
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,390
material side. Let's get new and call it
flat. Let's add that there. We're going

388
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:10,400
flat. Let's add that there. We're going
 

389
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,990
flat. Let's add that there. We're going
to get another one. Call it

390
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:14,000
to get another one. Call it
 

391
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,830
to get another one. Call it
wire. And then you can see where it says

392
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:15,840
wire. And then you can see where it says
 

393
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,670
wire. And then you can see where it says
curve to mesh, mesh to curve. Just add

394
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:17,680
curve to mesh, mesh to curve. Just add
 

395
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,070
curve to mesh, mesh to curve. Just add
the wire material. And then we can just

396
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,080
the wire material. And then we can just
 

397
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,070
the wire material. And then we can just
call this one

398
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,080
call this one
 

399
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,350
call this one
cubes. They're all going to have the

400
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:23,360
cubes. They're all going to have the
 

401
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,950
cubes. They're all going to have the
same material. So we'll add that there.

402
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:24,960
same material. So we'll add that there.
 

403
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,830
same material. So we'll add that there.
So now we are ready to move on over to

404
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:27,840
So now we are ready to move on over to
 

405
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,589
So now we are ready to move on over to
the shading. So I'm going to switch this

406
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:29,599
the shading. So I'm going to switch this
 

407
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,990
the shading. So I'm going to switch this
window to the shader editor. And note up

408
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:32,000
window to the shader editor. And note up
 

409
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,309
window to the shader editor. And note up
here where you can grab your materials.

410
00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:34,319
here where you can grab your materials.
 

411
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,230
here where you can grab your materials.
So I'm going to go to cycles. You can

412
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:36,240
So I'm going to go to cycles. You can
 

413
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,150
So I'm going to go to cycles. You can
also render this in EV if you're more

414
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:38,160
also render this in EV if you're more
 

415
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,390
also render this in EV if you're more
comfortable in that engine. Um we're

416
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:40,400
comfortable in that engine. Um we're
 

417
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,830
comfortable in that engine. Um we're
going to be using cycles for all of

418
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:41,840
going to be using cycles for all of
 

419
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,670
going to be using cycles for all of
these materials. So, what I'm going to

420
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:43,680
these materials. So, what I'm going to
 

421
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,189
these materials. So, what I'm going to
do here is grab the flat material first.

422
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:47,199
do here is grab the flat material first.
 

423
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,550
do here is grab the flat material first.
I'm going to give it a black color. On

424
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:50,560
I'm going to give it a black color. On
 

425
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,430
I'm going to give it a black color. On
emission, I'm going to give it a red and

426
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:53,440
emission, I'm going to give it a red and
 

427
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,230
emission, I'm going to give it a red and
give it a strength of like three and

428
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:56,240
give it a strength of like three and
 

429
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,029
give it a strength of like three and
make the roughness really, really low.

430
00:07:59,029 --> 00:07:59,039
make the roughness really, really low.
 

431
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,950
make the roughness really, really low.
So, now we get this shiny emissive

432
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:00,960
So, now we get this shiny emissive
 

433
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,710
So, now we get this shiny emissive
floor, which is really going to make

434
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:02,720
floor, which is really going to make
 

435
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,189
floor, which is really going to make
this just look really awesome. Next

436
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:05,199
this just look really awesome. Next
 

437
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,950
this just look really awesome. Next
thing I want to do is when go over to

438
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:06,960
thing I want to do is when go over to
 

439
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,309
thing I want to do is when go over to
the wire, I'm actually going to go hover

440
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:08,319
the wire, I'm actually going to go hover
 

441
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,350
the wire, I'm actually going to go hover
over here and hit C. I'm going to grab

442
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:11,360
over here and hit C. I'm going to grab
 

443
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,309
over here and hit C. I'm going to grab
the wire and do the same exact thing.

444
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:14,319
the wire and do the same exact thing.
 

445
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,230
the wire and do the same exact thing.
Roughness, low, emission. I'm going to

446
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:16,240
Roughness, low, emission. I'm going to
 

447
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,589
Roughness, low, emission. I'm going to
paste that there and give it a strength

448
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:17,599
paste that there and give it a strength
 

449
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,230
paste that there and give it a strength
of three. So, now we have these emissive

450
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:20,240
of three. So, now we have these emissive
 

451
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,589
of three. So, now we have these emissive
wireframes. Now, for the fun part, one

452
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:23,599
wireframes. Now, for the fun part, one
 

453
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,309
wireframes. Now, for the fun part, one
of the fun parts really, is getting

454
00:08:26,309 --> 00:08:26,319
of the fun parts really, is getting
 

455
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,909
of the fun parts really, is getting
these cubes to look really cool. So,

456
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:27,919
these cubes to look really cool. So,
 

457
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,230
these cubes to look really cool. So,
let's bring the metallic up. We'll bring

458
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:30,240
let's bring the metallic up. We'll bring
 

459
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,029
let's bring the metallic up. We'll bring
the color somewhere over here. And we're

460
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:33,039
the color somewhere over here. And we're
 

461
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,949
the color somewhere over here. And we're
going to play with roughness first. So,

462
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:34,959
going to play with roughness first. So,
 

463
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:36,469
going to play with roughness first. So,
we're going to get a mix color cuz we're

464
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:36,479
we're going to get a mix color cuz we're
 

465
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,070
we're going to get a mix color cuz we're
going to combine two materials. This is

466
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:38,080
going to combine two materials. This is
 

467
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,589
going to combine two materials. This is
one of my favorite ways to make an

468
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:39,599
one of my favorite ways to make an
 

469
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,829
one of my favorite ways to make an
interesting sci-fi material. So, let's

470
00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:41,839
interesting sci-fi material. So, let's
 

471
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,550
interesting sci-fi material. So, let's
go ahead and get in a

472
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:44,560
go ahead and get in a
 

473
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,790
go ahead and get in a
noise texture. If you have the node

474
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:46,800
noise texture. If you have the node
 

475
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,310
noise texture. If you have the node
wrangler add-on enabled, I'm going to

476
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:48,320
wrangler add-on enabled, I'm going to
 

477
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,190
wrangler add-on enabled, I'm going to
hit CtrlT, get the object coordinate,

478
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:51,200
hit CtrlT, get the object coordinate,
 

479
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,829
hit CtrlT, get the object coordinate,
and plug factor into A. And I just want

480
00:08:53,829 --> 00:08:53,839
and plug factor into A. And I just want
 

481
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,430
and plug factor into A. And I just want
to look at A. So, that's going to be to

482
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:55,440
to look at A. So, that's going to be to
 

483
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,750
to look at A. So, that's going to be to
the left. And we also need a color ramp.

484
00:08:59,750 --> 00:08:59,760
the left. And we also need a color ramp.
 

485
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,710
the left. And we also need a color ramp.
So, let's bring this in. Bring that in.

486
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:02,720
So, let's bring this in. Bring that in.
 

487
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,990
So, let's bring this in. Bring that in.
We're starting to get something really

488
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,000
We're starting to get something really
 

489
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,790
We're starting to get something really
cool. I'm going to bring my detail to 12

490
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:06,800
cool. I'm going to bring my detail to 12
 

491
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,150
cool. I'm going to bring my detail to 12
and my roughness really high and then

492
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:10,160
and my roughness really high and then
 

493
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,829
and my roughness really high and then
just bring this down a bit. So, right

494
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:13,839
just bring this down a bit. So, right
 

495
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,590
just bring this down a bit. So, right
about now, I think is when I'm going to

496
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:15,600
about now, I think is when I'm going to
 

497
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,550
about now, I think is when I'm going to
pick my composition and my lighting cuz

498
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:18,560
pick my composition and my lighting cuz
 

499
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,230
pick my composition and my lighting cuz
the lighting is going to greatly affect

500
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:20,240
the lighting is going to greatly affect
 

501
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,310
the lighting is going to greatly affect
the decisions that I'm going to make

502
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:22,320
the decisions that I'm going to make
 

503
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,710
the decisions that I'm going to make
with the shading, especially with

504
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:24,720
with the shading, especially with
 

505
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,630
with the shading, especially with
roughness and reflection. So, I want to

506
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:26,640
roughness and reflection. So, I want to
 

507
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,790
roughness and reflection. So, I want to
set up my lighting now. So, that means I

508
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:28,800
set up my lighting now. So, that means I
 

509
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,230
set up my lighting now. So, that means I
also want to set up my camera view.

510
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:32,240
also want to set up my camera view.
 

511
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,230
also want to set up my camera view.
So

512
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:36,240

 

513
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,790

maybe something like that.

514
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:40,800

 

515
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,470

That's a pretty cool angle. Yeah. All

516
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:42,480
That's a pretty cool angle. Yeah. All
 

517
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,870
That's a pretty cool angle. Yeah. All
right.

518
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:44,880
right.
 

519
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,870
right.
Creates this big red channel so we can

520
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:46,880
Creates this big red channel so we can
 

521
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,630
Creates this big red channel so we can
appreciate details. And also there's

522
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:48,640
appreciate details. And also there's
 

523
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,910
appreciate details. And also there's
going to be a lot of other details here

524
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:49,920
going to be a lot of other details here
 

525
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,829
going to be a lot of other details here
that uh are missing with the small

526
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:51,839
that uh are missing with the small
 

527
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,949
that uh are missing with the small
objects. So I'm going to bring a render

528
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:54,959
objects. So I'm going to bring a render
 

529
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,110
objects. So I'm going to bring a render
region in. And then we're going to go

530
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,120
region in. And then we're going to go
 

531
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,070
region in. And then we're going to go
here to the normal lights and let's get

532
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,080
here to the normal lights and let's get
 

533
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,630
here to the normal lights and let's get
an area light going. So, I want the

534
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:02,640
an area light going. So, I want the
 

535
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,310
an area light going. So, I want the
lighting

536
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:06,320

 

537
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,829

to come in. If we're looking at the

538
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:07,839
to come in. If we're looking at the
 

539
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,350
to come in. If we're looking at the
camera, I want the lighting to hit this

540
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:09,360
camera, I want the lighting to hit this
 

541
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,949
camera, I want the lighting to hit this
direction.

542
00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:10,959
direction.
 

543
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,790
direction.
So, I'm going to switch this light over

544
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:12,800
So, I'm going to switch this light over
 

545
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,710
So, I'm going to switch this light over
to a disc.

546
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:14,720
to a disc.
 

547
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,389
to a disc.
Hit R twice.

548
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:20,399

 

549
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,350

Going to scale it up a little bit.

550
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:23,360
Going to scale it up a little bit.
 

551
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,630
Going to scale it up a little bit.
Bring that brightness up. I'm going to

552
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:24,640
Bring that brightness up. I'm going to
 

553
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,230
Bring that brightness up. I'm going to
bring that spread in a little bit

554
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:26,240
bring that spread in a little bit
 

555
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,910
bring that spread in a little bit
because what I want is some areas of

556
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:27,920
because what I want is some areas of
 

557
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,269
because what I want is some areas of
contrast. And actually, we're going to

558
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:29,279
contrast. And actually, we're going to
 

559
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,509
contrast. And actually, we're going to
make this light smaller.

560
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:31,519
make this light smaller.
 

561
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,069
make this light smaller.
What I want is some points of contrast

562
00:10:34,069 --> 00:10:34,079
What I want is some points of contrast
 

563
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,350
What I want is some points of contrast
where the light is uh not quite as

564
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:37,360
where the light is uh not quite as
 

565
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,710
where the light is uh not quite as
present.

566
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:40,720

 

567
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,350

So, we'll just shrink him a little bit.

568
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:43,360
So, we'll just shrink him a little bit.
 

569
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,470
So, we'll just shrink him a little bit.
We're make make him a lot darker and

570
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:46,480
We're make make him a lot darker and
 

571
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,190
We're make make him a lot darker and
we're going to make him a light green.

572
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:49,200
we're going to make him a light green.
 

573
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,550
we're going to make him a light green.
Okay. So, now we can go back to looking

574
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:52,560
Okay. So, now we can go back to looking
 

575
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,110
Okay. So, now we can go back to looking
at our materials because now the light

576
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:55,120
at our materials because now the light
 

577
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,430
at our materials because now the light
you can see, you can't really tell the

578
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:57,440
you can see, you can't really tell the
 

579
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,710
you can see, you can't really tell the
details here, but you can see details

580
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:58,720
details here, but you can see details
 

581
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,750
details here, but you can see details
here. So that is uh the big reason we

582
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:01,760
here. So that is uh the big reason we
 

583
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,310
here. So that is uh the big reason we
want to set up our lighting now. And all

584
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:04,320
want to set up our lighting now. And all
 

585
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,710
want to set up our lighting now. And all
of our lighting decisions

586
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:06,720
of our lighting decisions
 

587
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,670
of our lighting decisions
greatly affect what's going on here.

588
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:09,680
greatly affect what's going on here.
 

589
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,310
greatly affect what's going on here.
So we're going to get this roughness

590
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:12,320
So we're going to get this roughness
 

591
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,990
So we're going to get this roughness
pretty high. So I'm going to bring this

592
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,000
pretty high. So I'm going to bring this
 

593
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,829
pretty high. So I'm going to bring this
in. So notice we can start to make out

594
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:15,839
in. So notice we can start to make out
 

595
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,829
in. So notice we can start to make out
these details

596
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:17,839
these details
 

597
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,470
these details
in the noise texture

598
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:20,480
in the noise texture
 

599
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,630
in the noise texture
like that. Now let's go ahead and make

600
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:22,640
like that. Now let's go ahead and make
 

601
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,430
like that. Now let's go ahead and make
another pattern. So we're going to get a

602
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:25,440
another pattern. So we're going to get a
 

603
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,430
another pattern. So we're going to get a
voronoi.

604
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:27,440
voronoi.
 

605
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,430
voronoi.
We're going to plug vector here. I'm

606
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:29,440
We're going to plug vector here. I'm
 

607
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,509
We're going to plug vector here. I'm
going to go from uklitian to chbbyev.

608
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:31,519
going to go from uklitian to chbbyev.
 

609
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,069
going to go from uklitian to chbbyev.
And we're going to go to F2.

610
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:34,079
And we're going to go to F2.
 

611
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,389
And we're going to go to F2.
Let's get a color ramp as well. I'm just

612
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:36,399
Let's get a color ramp as well. I'm just
 

613
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,990
Let's get a color ramp as well. I'm just
going to highlight these and hit G to

614
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:38,000
going to highlight these and hit G to
 

615
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,430
going to highlight these and hit G to
move them back. And let's plug

616
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:41,440
move them back. And let's plug
 

617
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,430
move them back. And let's plug
everything here. And then let's bring

618
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:43,440
everything here. And then let's bring
 

619
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,870
everything here. And then let's bring
that factor over so we can just look at

620
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:44,880
that factor over so we can just look at
 

621
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,790
that factor over so we can just look at
that. So we see this really cool

622
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:46,800
that. So we see this really cool
 

623
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,990
that. So we see this really cool
pattern. I'm going to bring the scale

624
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,000
pattern. I'm going to bring the scale
 

625
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,470
pattern. I'm going to bring the scale
up quite a bit. Let's bring this Let's

626
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:52,480
up quite a bit. Let's bring this Let's
 

627
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,110
up quite a bit. Let's bring this Let's
bring the color ramp in so we can see

628
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:55,120
bring the color ramp in so we can see
 

629
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,350
bring the color ramp in so we can see
more of these details. And then

630
00:11:59,350 --> 00:11:59,360
more of these details. And then
 

631
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,110
more of these details. And then
if we zoom in here and we play with the

632
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:01,120
if we zoom in here and we play with the
 

633
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,350
if we zoom in here and we play with the
detail slider, there's a lot of really

634
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:03,360
detail slider, there's a lot of really
 

635
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,269
detail slider, there's a lot of really
cool

636
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:05,279
cool
 

637
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,870
cool
details we can now have access to and

638
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:08,880
details we can now have access to and
 

639
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,710
details we can now have access to and
make something really cool with. So

640
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:10,720
make something really cool with. So
 

641
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,230
make something really cool with. So
that's pretty cool and detailed. So then

642
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:12,240
that's pretty cool and detailed. So then
 

643
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,470
that's pretty cool and detailed. So then
if you bring this factor to the middle,

644
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:14,480
if you bring this factor to the middle,
 

645
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,350
if you bring this factor to the middle,
you can mix the roughness, you can see

646
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:19,360
you can mix the roughness, you can see
 

647
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,629
you can mix the roughness, you can see
with the noise. So you get this nice

648
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:22,639
with the noise. So you get this nice
 

649
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,670
with the noise. So you get this nice
combination of the two. So we like that.

650
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:25,680
combination of the two. So we like that.
 

651
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,430
combination of the two. So we like that.
and it really highlights over here. So

652
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:27,440
and it really highlights over here. So
 

653
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,190
and it really highlights over here. So
now we have like the roughness portion.

654
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:29,200
now we have like the roughness portion.
 

655
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,710
now we have like the roughness portion.
We have some interesting details here,

656
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:30,720
We have some interesting details here,
 

657
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,590
We have some interesting details here,
especially in the highlights. But let's

658
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:33,600
especially in the highlights. But let's
 

659
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,389
especially in the highlights. But let's
go ahead and get a bump node so we can

660
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:36,399
go ahead and get a bump node so we can
 

661
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,790
go ahead and get a bump node so we can
start to get some more void voronoi

662
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:38,800
start to get some more void voronoi
 

663
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,269
start to get some more void voronoi
patterns that actually interact with the

664
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:41,279
patterns that actually interact with the
 

665
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,629
patterns that actually interact with the
lighting. So if I plug bump into normal,

666
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:44,639
lighting. So if I plug bump into normal,
 

667
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,750
lighting. So if I plug bump into normal,
we're just going to get a brand new

668
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:45,760
we're just going to get a brand new
 

669
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,550
we're just going to get a brand new
voroi texture. Plug that vector right

670
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:48,560
voroi texture. Plug that vector right
 

671
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,030
voroi texture. Plug that vector right
into there. And then plug color into

672
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,040
into there. And then plug color into
 

673
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,629
into there. And then plug color into
height. And you're not going to see

674
00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:52,639
height. And you're not going to see
 

675
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,550
height. And you're not going to see
much. If this is your first time dealing

676
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:54,560
much. If this is your first time dealing
 

677
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,310
much. If this is your first time dealing
with this new update, play with the

678
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:56,320
with this new update, play with the
 

679
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,910
with this new update, play with the
filter width, and that's going to make

680
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:57,920
filter width, and that's going to make
 

681
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,310
filter width, and that's going to make
those cracks a lot more visible. So,

682
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:00,320
those cracks a lot more visible. So,
 

683
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,030
those cracks a lot more visible. So,
we're going to go to chvy,

684
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:03,040
we're going to go to chvy,
 

685
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,629
we're going to go to chvy,
bring the scale up on this one, and

686
00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:04,639
bring the scale up on this one, and
 

687
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,069
bring the scale up on this one, and
again, bring up that filter width, and

688
00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:06,079
again, bring up that filter width, and
 

689
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,670
again, bring up that filter width, and
you're going to get a more dramatic look

690
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:07,680
you're going to get a more dramatic look
 

691
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,710
you're going to get a more dramatic look
on that pattern. And that's what we're

692
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:10,720
on that pattern. And that's what we're
 

693
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,949
on that pattern. And that's what we're
looking for there. And then what I want

694
00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:12,959
looking for there. And then what I want
 

695
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,949
looking for there. And then what I want
to do, we're going to get a mix color,

696
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:14,959
to do, we're going to get a mix color,
 

697
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,150
to do, we're going to get a mix color,
and we're going to mix two different

698
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:16,160
and we're going to mix two different
 

699
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,190
and we're going to mix two different
patterns together. So, I'm going to

700
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:17,200
patterns together. So, I'm going to
 

701
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,269
patterns together. So, I'm going to
bring the factor over to the right and

702
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:19,279
bring the factor over to the right and
 

703
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,750
bring the factor over to the right and
get I'm going to hit control shift D.

704
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:21,760
get I'm going to hit control shift D.
 

705
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,990
get I'm going to hit control shift D.
Get a brand new Voronoi. And I hit

706
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:24,000
Get a brand new Voronoi. And I hit
 

707
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,230
Get a brand new Voronoi. And I hit
control shift D so that it plugs that

708
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:26,240
control shift D so that it plugs that
 

709
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,110
control shift D so that it plugs that
mapping into the vector. What I want to

710
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:29,120
mapping into the vector. What I want to
 

711
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,430
mapping into the vector. What I want to
do now is just bring up the scale. We're

712
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:31,440
do now is just bring up the scale. We're
 

713
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,990
do now is just bring up the scale. We're
going to go to an F2. And then again,

714
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:34,000
going to go to an F2. And then again,
 

715
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,509
going to go to an F2. And then again,
you can play with that detail to get

716
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:35,519
you can play with that detail to get
 

717
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,190
you can play with that detail to get
more or less detail depending on how you

718
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:37,200
more or less detail depending on how you
 

719
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,069
more or less detail depending on how you
want it to look. So now we have on the

720
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:40,079
want it to look. So now we have on the
 

721
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,949
want it to look. So now we have on the
mix this

722
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:42,959
mix this
 

723
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,110
mix this
and that. And here's a really cool trick

724
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:45,120
and that. And here's a really cool trick
 

725
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,269
and that. And here's a really cool trick
I really love to do with Voronoi is I'm

726
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:47,279
I really love to do with Voronoi is I'm
 

727
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,910
I really love to do with Voronoi is I'm
going to get a color ramp.

728
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:49,920
going to get a color ramp.
 

729
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,389
going to get a color ramp.
Switch this color ramp to uh constant so

730
00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:52,399
Switch this color ramp to uh constant so
 

731
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,389
Switch this color ramp to uh constant so
there's no soft gradient between these

732
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:54,399
there's no soft gradient between these
 

733
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,790
there's no soft gradient between these
two details and this Voro texture with

734
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:56,800
two details and this Voro texture with
 

735
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,310
two details and this Voro texture with
the big scale the with the value of 2.1.

736
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:00,320
the big scale the with the value of 2.1.
 

737
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,710
the big scale the with the value of 2.1.
Plug that right into there and then plug

738
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:02,720
Plug that right into there and then plug
 

739
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,189
Plug that right into there and then plug
this into the factor and it's going to

740
00:14:05,189 --> 00:14:05,199
this into the factor and it's going to
 

741
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,750
this into the factor and it's going to
segment out

742
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:07,760
segment out
 

743
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,870
segment out
where that really detailed section is

744
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:10,880
where that really detailed section is
 

745
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,710
where that really detailed section is
going to show up. And then you can just

746
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:12,720
going to show up. And then you can just
 

747
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,389
going to show up. And then you can just
go to a 4D and play with a seed value of

748
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:16,399
go to a 4D and play with a seed value of
 

749
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,870
go to a 4D and play with a seed value of
where that is going to be. Actually,

750
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:18,880
where that is going to be. Actually,
 

751
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,150
where that is going to be. Actually,
this is really cool right here actually.

752
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:22,160
this is really cool right here actually.
 

753
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,389
this is really cool right here actually.
So, we can just play around. So, this is

754
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:24,399
So, we can just play around. So, this is
 

755
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,790
So, we can just play around. So, this is
really nice. It's We have some really

756
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:26,800
really nice. It's We have some really
 

757
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,629
really nice. It's We have some really
cool detail. In fact, I think the filter

758
00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:30,639
cool detail. In fact, I think the filter
 

759
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,550
cool detail. In fact, I think the filter
is really strong. I think I'm going to

760
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:32,560
is really strong. I think I'm going to
 

761
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,150
is really strong. I think I'm going to
bring that down. Okay, cool. So, now we

762
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:34,160
bring that down. Okay, cool. So, now we
 

763
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,590
bring that down. Okay, cool. So, now we
have this. What I want to do now is to

764
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:37,600
have this. What I want to do now is to
 

765
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,030
have this. What I want to do now is to
play around with a little bit of

766
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,040
play around with a little bit of
 

767
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,150
play around with a little bit of
emission on this material as well.

768
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:42,160
emission on this material as well.
 

769
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,310
emission on this material as well.
So we can get some light in these really

770
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:44,320
So we can get some light in these really
 

771
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,910
So we can get some light in these really
highly detailed portions. So what we're

772
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:45,920
highly detailed portions. So what we're
 

773
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,269
highly detailed portions. So what we're
going to do is we're going to get

774
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:47,279
going to do is we're going to get
 

775
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,030
going to do is we're going to get
another mix color. We're going to make

776
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,040
another mix color. We're going to make
 

777
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,710
another mix color. We're going to make
this one black. We're going to get a

778
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:50,720
this one black. We're going to get a
 

779
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,430
this one black. We're going to get a
color ramp.

780
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:53,440
color ramp.
 

781
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,430
color ramp.
Plug that into B and make this that red.

782
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:57,440
Plug that into B and make this that red.
 

783
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,910
Plug that into B and make this that red.
So what we're going to do going to bring

784
00:14:59,910 --> 00:14:59,920
So what we're going to do going to bring
 

785
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,389
So what we're going to do going to bring
that color back up.

786
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:02,399
that color back up.
 

787
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,269
that color back up.
Make that red. And let's plug this color

788
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:05,279
Make that red. And let's plug this color
 

789
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,230
Make that red. And let's plug this color
with the really high scale into there.

790
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:08,240
with the really high scale into there.
 

791
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,350
with the really high scale into there.
So now you can see

792
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:11,360
So now you can see
 

793
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,350
So now you can see
that happening.

794
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:13,360
that happening.
 

795
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,030
that happening.
And then we're going to plug this color

796
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:15,040
And then we're going to plug this color
 

797
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,350
And then we're going to plug this color
ramp right into the factor. And it's

798
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:17,360
ramp right into the factor. And it's
 

799
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,110
ramp right into the factor. And it's
going to isolate that emission to those

800
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:21,120
going to isolate that emission to those
 

801
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,150
going to isolate that emission to those
spots with the really cool high detail.

802
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:24,160
spots with the really cool high detail.
 

803
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,430
spots with the really cool high detail.
And so now what I'm going to do is I'm

804
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:25,440
And so now what I'm going to do is I'm
 

805
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,710
And so now what I'm going to do is I'm
just going to switch this from linear to

806
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:26,720
just going to switch this from linear to
 

807
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,430
just going to switch this from linear to
constant and decide how much light

808
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:31,440
constant and decide how much light
 

809
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,389
constant and decide how much light
I want in this scene. And there we go.

810
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:34,399
I want in this scene. And there we go.
 

811
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,350
I want in this scene. And there we go.
Now we have all of this working

812
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:37,360
Now we have all of this working
 

813
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,030
Now we have all of this working
together. and looking really cool. Now,

814
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:39,040
together. and looking really cool. Now,
 

815
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,150
together. and looking really cool. Now,
let's deal with the

816
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:42,160
let's deal with the
 

817
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,870
let's deal with the
flat portion of this tutorial. So, let's

818
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:44,880
flat portion of this tutorial. So, let's
 

819
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,949
flat portion of this tutorial. So, let's
go ahead and get another mix color for

820
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:46,959
go ahead and get another mix color for
 

821
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,990
go ahead and get another mix color for
here. This is probably my favorite part

822
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:50,000
here. This is probably my favorite part
 

823
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,670
here. This is probably my favorite part
of this tutorial. So, let's get this mix

824
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:51,680
of this tutorial. So, let's get this mix
 

825
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,230
of this tutorial. So, let's get this mix
color here. Plug that there. We'll get a

826
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:54,240
color here. Plug that there. We'll get a
 

827
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,710
color here. Plug that there. We'll get a
color ramp.

828
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:56,720
color ramp.
 

829
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,629
color ramp.
Plug that on the bottom and make this

830
00:15:58,629 --> 00:15:58,639
Plug that on the bottom and make this
 

831
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,269
Plug that on the bottom and make this
portion black and this part of the color

832
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:01,279
portion black and this part of the color
 

833
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,150
portion black and this part of the color
ramp a nice red just like we've been

834
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:04,160
ramp a nice red just like we've been
 

835
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,590
ramp a nice red just like we've been
dealing with. So, what we're going to do

836
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:05,600
dealing with. So, what we're going to do
 

837
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,269
dealing with. So, what we're going to do
now is get a wave texture and then get a

838
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:09,279
now is get a wave texture and then get a
 

839
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,189
now is get a wave texture and then get a
CtrlT

840
00:16:11,189 --> 00:16:11,199
CtrlT
 

841
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,910
CtrlT
mapping setup and plug that here. So,

842
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:13,920
mapping setup and plug that here. So,
 

843
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,470
mapping setup and plug that here. So,
I'm going to switch this over to Y and

844
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:16,480
I'm going to switch this over to Y and
 

845
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,030
I'm going to switch this over to Y and
then bring that keep that scale

846
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:19,040
then bring that keep that scale
 

847
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,790
then bring that keep that scale
something like this. And now, let's go

848
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:20,800
something like this. And now, let's go
 

849
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,269
something like this. And now, let's go
ahead get another color ramp and another

850
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:25,279
ahead get another color ramp and another
 

851
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,030
ahead get another color ramp and another
wave texture. And we're going to make

852
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,040
wave texture. And we're going to make
 

853
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,269
wave texture. And we're going to make
something really cool. Let's plug

854
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:29,279
something really cool. Let's plug
 

855
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,110
something really cool. Let's plug
mapping here, color here, and then color

856
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:33,120
mapping here, color here, and then color
 

857
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,030
mapping here, color here, and then color
into the factor. and it's going to make

858
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,040
into the factor. and it's going to make
 

859
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,870
into the factor. and it's going to make
this really cool looking scene. So, what

860
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:36,880
this really cool looking scene. So, what
 

861
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,350
this really cool looking scene. So, what
I can do here on the color ramp is I'm

862
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:39,360
I can do here on the color ramp is I'm
 

863
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,790
I can do here on the color ramp is I'm
going to copy this color just by hitting

864
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:40,800
going to copy this color just by hitting
 

865
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,670
going to copy this color just by hitting
Ctrl + C, click that, Ctrl +V, and then

866
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:43,680
Ctrl + C, click that, Ctrl +V, and then
 

867
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,749
Ctrl + C, click that, Ctrl +V, and then
bringing that down. And then I'm just

868
00:16:45,749 --> 00:16:45,759
bringing that down. And then I'm just
 

869
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,069
bringing that down. And then I'm just
going to bring the scale up, bring the

870
00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:48,079
going to bring the scale up, bring the
 

871
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,790
going to bring the scale up, bring the
scale down on this.

872
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:50,800
scale down on this.
 

873
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,629
scale down on this.
And you get this really interesting

874
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:52,639
And you get this really interesting
 

875
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,310
And you get this really interesting
color variation. And so now it's going

876
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:54,320
color variation. And so now it's going
 

877
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,829
color variation. And so now it's going
to leave you with multiple ways to

878
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:55,839
to leave you with multiple ways to
 

879
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,430
to leave you with multiple ways to
animate with the phase offset. So you

880
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:57,440
animate with the phase offset. So you
 

881
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,990
animate with the phase offset. So you
can animate the location phase offset

882
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:00,000
can animate the location phase offset
 

883
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,350
can animate the location phase offset
there and the phase offset here. And it

884
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:03,360
there and the phase offset here. And it
 

885
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,750
there and the phase offset here. And it
does create this really interesting kind

886
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:05,760
does create this really interesting kind
 

887
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,630
does create this really interesting kind
of visually makes it look like it widens

888
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:08,640
of visually makes it look like it widens
 

889
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,909
of visually makes it look like it widens
and shrinks. Now that's cool. I do want

890
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:13,919
and shrinks. Now that's cool. I do want
 

891
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,230
and shrinks. Now that's cool. I do want
even more detail in this color. I want

892
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:16,240
even more detail in this color. I want
 

893
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,390
even more detail in this color. I want
more variation. And rather than doing

894
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:18,400
more variation. And rather than doing
 

895
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,630
more variation. And rather than doing
that through color, we can do that

896
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:20,640
that through color, we can do that
 

897
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,189
that through color, we can do that
through strength of emission. So what we

898
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:23,199
through strength of emission. So what we
 

899
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,909
through strength of emission. So what we
can do is get a map range instead of a

900
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:25,919
can do is get a map range instead of a
 

901
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,029
can do is get a map range instead of a
color ramp. The reason why we're using a

902
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:27,039
color ramp. The reason why we're using a
 

903
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,789
color ramp. The reason why we're using a
map range cuz I want to deal with values

904
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:28,799
map range cuz I want to deal with values
 

905
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,190
map range cuz I want to deal with values
and not uh I want to use numerical

906
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:31,200
and not uh I want to use numerical
 

907
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,510
and not uh I want to use numerical
values and not color values so that we

908
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:33,520
values and not color values so that we
 

909
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,270
values and not color values so that we
can be a little bit more uh exact and

910
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:35,280
can be a little bit more uh exact and
 

911
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,350
can be a little bit more uh exact and
have some some control. And then I'm

912
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:37,360
have some some control. And then I'm
 

913
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,070
have some some control. And then I'm
going to get a voronoi texture with its

914
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:40,080
going to get a voronoi texture with its
 

915
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,070
going to get a voronoi texture with its
own mapping setup cuz we want to be able

916
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:42,080
own mapping setup cuz we want to be able
 

917
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,070
own mapping setup cuz we want to be able
to manipulate that here. And then we'll

918
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:44,080
to manipulate that here. And then we'll
 

919
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,070
to manipulate that here. And then we'll
plug color right into value. It's going

920
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:46,080
plug color right into value. It's going
 

921
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,070
plug color right into value. It's going
to do that. And then I'm going to switch

922
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:48,080
to do that. And then I'm going to switch
 

923
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,909
to do that. And then I'm going to switch
this to

924
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:49,919
this to
 

925
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,310
this to
chby and stretch it out

926
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:54,320
chby and stretch it out
 

927
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,470
chby and stretch it out
like this.

928
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:56,480
like this.
 

929
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,549
like this.
And then we can play with that minimum

930
00:17:58,549 --> 00:17:58,559
And then we can play with that minimum
 

931
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:03,510
And then we can play with that minimum
and that maximum to provide

932
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:03,520
and that maximum to provide
 

933
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,630
and that maximum to provide
even more

934
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:06,640
even more
 

935
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,470
even more
detail on the ground portion which again

936
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:10,480
detail on the ground portion which again
 

937
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,390
detail on the ground portion which again
provides another opportunity for

938
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:12,400
provides another opportunity for
 

939
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,870
provides another opportunity for
animation. I didn't animate it in mine

940
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:14,880
animation. I didn't animate it in mine
 

941
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,310
animation. I didn't animate it in mine
but that's you can totally do it in

942
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:16,320
but that's you can totally do it in
 

943
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,750
but that's you can totally do it in
yours. Now notice this really hard edge

944
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:19,760
yours. Now notice this really hard edge
 

945
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,310
yours. Now notice this really hard edge
that the voroi is creating. I don't

946
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:22,320
that the voroi is creating. I don't
 

947
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,390
that the voroi is creating. I don't
prefer that. So, I'm going to go here to

948
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:24,400
prefer that. So, I'm going to go here to
 

949
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,150
prefer that. So, I'm going to go here to
a smooth F1. I'm going to bring that

950
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:26,160
a smooth F1. I'm going to bring that
 

951
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,430
a smooth F1. I'm going to bring that
smoothness down to bring it back to

952
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:27,440
smoothness down to bring it back to
 

953
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,990
smoothness down to bring it back to
where it was. And then just smoothen a

954
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:30,000
where it was. And then just smoothen a
 

955
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,390
where it was. And then just smoothen a
little bit. What I want is just a little

956
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:32,400
little bit. What I want is just a little
 

957
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,310
little bit. What I want is just a little
bit more

958
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:34,320
bit more
 

959
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,110
bit more
uh brightness variation. Cuz if we just

960
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:37,120
uh brightness variation. Cuz if we just
 

961
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,470
uh brightness variation. Cuz if we just
have nothing, we have this still cool

962
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:40,480
have nothing, we have this still cool
 

963
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,310
have nothing, we have this still cool
but boring kind of wave. If we add this,

964
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:44,320
but boring kind of wave. If we add this,
 

965
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,630
but boring kind of wave. If we add this,
it just brings an extra level of detail

966
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:46,640
it just brings an extra level of detail
 

967
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,630
it just brings an extra level of detail
that I really, really like. And then

968
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:48,640
that I really, really like. And then
 

969
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,750
that I really, really like. And then
what I'm going to do is just go ahead

970
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:49,760
what I'm going to do is just go ahead
 

971
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,150
what I'm going to do is just go ahead
and even out

972
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:52,160
and even out
 

973
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,750
and even out
some colors here.

974
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:55,760
some colors here.
 

975
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,150
some colors here.
And there we go. Now your maximum

976
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:58,160
And there we go. Now your maximum
 

977
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,230
And there we go. Now your maximum
emission is right here on the two max in

978
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:00,240
emission is right here on the two max in
 

979
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,630
emission is right here on the two max in
case you kind of lose it. And then here

980
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:02,640
case you kind of lose it. And then here
 

981
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,230
case you kind of lose it. And then here
on the wireframe, we're just going to

982
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:04,240
on the wireframe, we're just going to
 

983
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,510
on the wireframe, we're just going to
bring that brightness up a little bit

984
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:05,520
bring that brightness up a little bit
 

985
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,110
bring that brightness up a little bit
too.

986
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:07,120
too.
 

987
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,669
too.
So let's go back to geometry nodes and

988
00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:09,679
So let's go back to geometry nodes and
 

989
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,070
So let's go back to geometry nodes and
I'm going to go here on this value. I'm

990
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:12,080
I'm going to go here on this value. I'm
 

991
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,750
I'm going to go here on this value. I'm
just going to plug this value right here

992
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:13,760
just going to plug this value right here
 

993
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,669
just going to plug this value right here
into the density. It's going to bring

994
00:19:15,669 --> 00:19:15,679
into the density. It's going to bring
 

995
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,110
into the density. It's going to bring
all those guys back and now we can look

996
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:17,120
all those guys back and now we can look
 

997
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,750
all those guys back and now we can look
at it in the layout. So this is our

998
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:19,760
at it in the layout. So this is our
 

999
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,070
at it in the layout. So this is our
scene. Last thing I want to do, bring

1000
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:22,080
scene. Last thing I want to do, bring
 

1001
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,870
scene. Last thing I want to do, bring
the world to black. Go to my volume and

1002
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:24,880
the world to black. Go to my volume and
 

1003
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,590
the world to black. Go to my volume and
give it a principled volume node and

1004
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:27,600
give it a principled volume node and
 

1005
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,470
give it a principled volume node and
just give a little bit of volume into

1006
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:30,480
just give a little bit of volume into
 

1007
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,590
just give a little bit of volume into
the scene. It's hard to pull to make

1008
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:33,600
the scene. It's hard to pull to make
 

1009
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,510
the scene. It's hard to pull to make
out. So what I'm going to do to give

1010
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:35,520
out. So what I'm going to do to give
 

1011
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,150
out. So what I'm going to do to give
this a little bit more style is put a

1012
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:38,160
this a little bit more style is put a
 

1013
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,430
this a little bit more style is put a
point light right over here.

1014
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:41,440
point light right over here.
 

1015
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,669
point light right over here.
So I'm going hit shift A.

1016
00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:45,679

 

1017
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,270

So, I'm going to hit shift A, get a

1018
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:47,280
So, I'm going to hit shift A, get a
 

1019
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,310
So, I'm going to hit shift A, get a
point light, hit G, and move it over

1020
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:50,320
point light, hit G, and move it over
 

1021
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,110
point light, hit G, and move it over
here, and then give it a brightness of

1022
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:53,120
here, and then give it a brightness of
 

1023
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,029
here, and then give it a brightness of
like 800. That's 8,000.

1024
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:57,039
like 800. That's 8,000.
 

1025
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,710
like 800. That's 8,000.
And then make it a nice red. And so that

1026
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:00,720
And then make it a nice red. And so that
 

1027
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,270
And then make it a nice red. And so that
is going to conflict with this green

1028
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:03,280
is going to conflict with this green
 

1029
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,470
is going to conflict with this green
light over here that I'm going to

1030
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:04,480
light over here that I'm going to
 

1031
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,430
light over here that I'm going to
saturate a little bit more.

1032
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:07,440
saturate a little bit more.
 

1033
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,110
saturate a little bit more.
There we go. So now the volume is going

1034
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:09,120
There we go. So now the volume is going
 

1035
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,710
There we go. So now the volume is going
to feel a little bit more full. This

1036
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:10,720
to feel a little bit more full. This
 

1037
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,070
to feel a little bit more full. This
whole scene is going to feel a little

1038
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:12,080
whole scene is going to feel a little
 

1039
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,909
whole scene is going to feel a little
bit better. So, I'm going to render this

1040
00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:13,919
bit better. So, I'm going to render this
 

1041
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,150
bit better. So, I'm going to render this
once and we can see how this looks. And

1042
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:16,160
once and we can see how this looks. And
 

1043
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,549
once and we can see how this looks. And
here we have it, our final piece.

1044
00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:18,559
here we have it, our final piece.
 

1045
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,390
here we have it, our final piece.
There's a lot of little details that you

1046
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:20,400
There's a lot of little details that you
 

1047
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,789
There's a lot of little details that you
can go back and refine. Uh, it feels

1048
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:22,799
can go back and refine. Uh, it feels
 

1049
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,230
can go back and refine. Uh, it feels
obviously with the tutorials you're

1050
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:24,240
obviously with the tutorials you're
 

1051
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,909
obviously with the tutorials you're
running and running, but take your time

1052
00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:25,919
running and running, but take your time
 

1053
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,990
running and running, but take your time
and adjust things like the size of the

1054
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:28,000
and adjust things like the size of the
 

1055
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,070
and adjust things like the size of the
wireframe, how the roughness looks, how

1056
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:30,080
wireframe, how the roughness looks, how
 

1057
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,830
wireframe, how the roughness looks, how
bright things are, the lighting,

1058
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:31,840
bright things are, the lighting,
 

1059
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,909
bright things are, the lighting,
everything can be improved with designs

1060
00:20:33,909 --> 00:20:33,919
everything can be improved with designs
 

1061
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,029
everything can be improved with designs
like this. You can have a lot of fun

1062
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:35,039
like this. You can have a lot of fun
 

1063
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,149
like this. You can have a lot of fun
with it. But this is the full idea and

1064
00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:38,159
with it. But this is the full idea and
 

1065
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:39,750
with it. But this is the full idea and
that's how you do it. So, there you go.

1066
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:39,760
that's how you do it. So, there you go.
 

1067
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,789
that's how you do it. So, there you go.
That's how you create this really

1068
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:40,799
That's how you create this really
 

1069
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,070
That's how you create this really
beautiful render. a lot of really cool

1070
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:42,080
beautiful render. a lot of really cool
 

1071
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,190
beautiful render. a lot of really cool
things that you can apply to other

1072
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:43,200
things that you can apply to other
 

1073
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,950
things that you can apply to other
designs and other renders. Again, if you
