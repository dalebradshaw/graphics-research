Recently, Blender Guru said that he

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:01,920
Recently, Blender Guru said that he
 

3
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,150
Recently, Blender Guru said that he
would not recommend beginners to learn

4
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:04,160
would not recommend beginners to learn
 

5
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,070
would not recommend beginners to learn
geometry nodes. And I completely agree

6
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:06,080
geometry nodes. And I completely agree
 

7
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,749
geometry nodes. And I completely agree
with that. But I want to go a little bit

8
00:00:07,749 --> 00:00:07,759
with that. But I want to go a little bit
 

9
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,070
with that. But I want to go a little bit
deeper into that specific point. So what

10
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:10,080
deeper into that specific point. So what
 

11
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,070
deeper into that specific point. So what
I want to talk about is who is geometry

12
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:12,080
I want to talk about is who is geometry
 

13
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,749
I want to talk about is who is geometry
nodes for? Who's going to use it more

14
00:00:13,749 --> 00:00:13,759
nodes for? Who's going to use it more
 

15
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,990
nodes for? Who's going to use it more
often? At what point in learning Blender

16
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:16,000
often? At what point in learning Blender
 

17
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,510
often? At what point in learning Blender
should you probably start learning

18
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:17,520
should you probably start learning
 

19
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,910
should you probably start learning
geometry nodes? And in my opinion, the

20
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:19,920
geometry nodes? And in my opinion, the
 

21
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,550
geometry nodes? And in my opinion, the
best structured way to learn that tool.

22
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:22,560
best structured way to learn that tool.
 

23
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,509
best structured way to learn that tool.
So who's geometry nodes for? It's for

24
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:25,519
So who's geometry nodes for? It's for
 

25
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,550
So who's geometry nodes for? It's for
everybody kind of, but in varying

26
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:28,560
everybody kind of, but in varying
 

27
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,710
everybody kind of, but in varying
degrees. So, this is a list of a lot of

28
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:30,720
degrees. So, this is a list of a lot of
 

29
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,670
degrees. So, this is a list of a lot of
the major ways that Blender is used.

30
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:33,680
the major ways that Blender is used.
 

31
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,190
the major ways that Blender is used.
Kind of most 3D applications, but

32
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:35,200
Kind of most 3D applications, but
 

33
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,990
Kind of most 3D applications, but
Blender specifically, this is a ton of

34
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:38,000
Blender specifically, this is a ton of
 

35
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,950
Blender specifically, this is a ton of
major uses of Blender. I ordered them

36
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:40,960
major uses of Blender. I ordered them
 

37
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,110
major uses of Blender. I ordered them
just randomly. Now, I've reordered them

38
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:43,120
just randomly. Now, I've reordered them
 

39
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,750
just randomly. Now, I've reordered them
in what my opinion is, who is going to

40
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:45,760
in what my opinion is, who is going to
 

41
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,590
in what my opinion is, who is going to
use it more often at the top all the way

42
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:47,600
use it more often at the top all the way
 

43
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,590
use it more often at the top all the way
to the bottom, kind of not using it much

44
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:49,600
to the bottom, kind of not using it much
 

45
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,750
to the bottom, kind of not using it much
at all. I think environment artists are

46
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:51,760
at all. I think environment artists are
 

47
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,430
at all. I think environment artists are
going to be using it the most. You could

48
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:53,440
going to be using it the most. You could
 

49
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,270
going to be using it the most. You could
build assets that can have tons and tons

50
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:55,280
build assets that can have tons and tons
 

51
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,389
build assets that can have tons and tons
of variation. And then you could take

52
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:56,399
of variation. And then you could take
 

53
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,389
of variation. And then you could take
that asset and then scatter it in tons

54
00:00:58,389 --> 00:00:58,399
that asset and then scatter it in tons
 

55
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,069
that asset and then scatter it in tons
and tons of different variation. Right

56
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:00,079
and tons of different variation. Right
 

57
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,990
and tons of different variation. Right
after that, guys like me, motion

58
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:02,000
after that, guys like me, motion
 

59
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,990
after that, guys like me, motion
graphics artists, having the ability to

60
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:04,000
graphics artists, having the ability to
 

61
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,469
graphics artists, having the ability to
iterate really quickly, build really

62
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:06,479
iterate really quickly, build really
 

63
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,230
iterate really quickly, build really
interesting structures pretty fast and

64
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:08,240
interesting structures pretty fast and
 

65
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,750
interesting structures pretty fast and
make them procedural so you can change

66
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:09,760
make them procedural so you can change
 

67
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,270
make them procedural so you can change
them and having a really cool creative

68
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:11,280
them and having a really cool creative
 

69
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,870
them and having a really cool creative
approach to modeling and building and

70
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:12,880
approach to modeling and building and
 

71
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,190
approach to modeling and building and
animating is very very useful and

72
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:15,200
animating is very very useful and
 

73
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,830
animating is very very useful and
procedural tends to lean toward having a

74
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:17,840
procedural tends to lean toward having a
 

75
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,749
procedural tends to lean toward having a
lot of expressive control. Then you have

76
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:19,759
lot of expressive control. Then you have
 

77
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,830
lot of expressive control. Then you have
visual effects artists, modelers,

78
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:21,840
visual effects artists, modelers,
 

79
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,910
visual effects artists, modelers,
specifically prototyping because in the

80
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:23,920
specifically prototyping because in the
 

81
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,830
specifically prototyping because in the
prototyping stage, the model doesn't

82
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:25,840
prototyping stage, the model doesn't
 

83
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,670
prototyping stage, the model doesn't
have to be perfect, but it's to help you

84
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:27,680
have to be perfect, but it's to help you
 

85
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,670
have to be perfect, but it's to help you
get really good ideas. So having a lot

86
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:29,680
get really good ideas. So having a lot
 

87
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,429
get really good ideas. So having a lot
of seed values for different components

88
00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:31,439
of seed values for different components
 

89
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,350
of seed values for different components
of a model so we can figure out which

90
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:33,360
of a model so we can figure out which
 

91
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,670
of a model so we can figure out which
direction this product is going to be is

92
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:35,680
direction this product is going to be is
 

93
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,590
direction this product is going to be is
really really useful. And the last one I

94
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:37,600
really really useful. And the last one I
 

95
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,429
really really useful. And the last one I
think is going to use it a lot is 3D

96
00:01:39,429 --> 00:01:39,439
think is going to use it a lot is 3D
 

97
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,429
think is going to use it a lot is 3D
printing. And then after that we have

98
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:41,439
printing. And then after that we have
 

99
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,670
printing. And then after that we have
things like simulations, animation,

100
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:43,680
things like simulations, animation,
 

101
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,510
things like simulations, animation,
motion tracking and compositing and

102
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:45,520
motion tracking and compositing and
 

103
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,149
motion tracking and compositing and
texturing are going to be using it very

104
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:48,159
texturing are going to be using it very
 

105
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,149
texturing are going to be using it very
little. I think a lot of the really

106
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:50,159
little. I think a lot of the really
 

107
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,389
little. I think a lot of the really
basic intermediate uses of geometry

108
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:52,399
basic intermediate uses of geometry
 

109
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,710
basic intermediate uses of geometry
nodes, you can do those things without

110
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:54,720
nodes, you can do those things without
 

111
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,389
nodes, you can do those things without
geometry nodes and I would say like

112
00:01:56,389 --> 00:01:56,399
geometry nodes and I would say like
 

113
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,990
geometry nodes and I would say like
older or pregeeometry nodes um tools,

114
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,000
older or pregeeometry nodes um tools,
 

115
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,749
older or pregeeometry nodes um tools,
which means you can get really

116
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:01,759
which means you can get really
 

117
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,990
which means you can get really
proficient in Blender for a long time

118
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:04,000
proficient in Blender for a long time
 

119
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,990
proficient in Blender for a long time
before you can really need to start

120
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:06,000
before you can really need to start
 

121
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,590
before you can really need to start
learning geometry nodes. Which leads me

122
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:07,600
learning geometry nodes. Which leads me
 

123
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,990
learning geometry nodes. Which leads me
to the next part. When should you start

124
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,000
to the next part. When should you start
 

125
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,589
to the next part. When should you start
learning geometry nodes if you are

126
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:11,599
learning geometry nodes if you are
 

127
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,110
learning geometry nodes if you are
someone who's probably going to benefit

128
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,120
someone who's probably going to benefit
 

129
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,589
someone who's probably going to benefit
from it? My simple answer is whenever

130
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:15,599
from it? My simple answer is whenever
 

131
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,350
from it? My simple answer is whenever
you feel comfortable in Blender and

132
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:17,360
you feel comfortable in Blender and
 

133
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,949
you feel comfortable in Blender and
you're making cool things without

134
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:18,959
you're making cool things without
 

135
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,190
you're making cool things without
geometry nodes. I'm a motion graphics

136
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:21,200
geometry nodes. I'm a motion graphics
 

137
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,670
geometry nodes. I'm a motion graphics
artist and I made several hundred

138
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:23,680
artist and I made several hundred
 

139
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,070
artist and I made several hundred
animations before Geometry Nodes was

140
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:26,080
animations before Geometry Nodes was
 

141
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,470
animations before Geometry Nodes was
even launched. But I will say once it

142
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:28,480
even launched. But I will say once it
 

143
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,070
even launched. But I will say once it
was launched and I started learning it

144
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:30,080
was launched and I started learning it
 

145
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,070
was launched and I started learning it
and getting good at it, my animations

146
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:32,080
and getting good at it, my animations
 

147
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,830
and getting good at it, my animations
got so much better, so much more

148
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:33,840
got so much better, so much more
 

149
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,990
got so much better, so much more
complex, and my ability to make really

150
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,000
complex, and my ability to make really
 

151
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,869
complex, and my ability to make really
professional animation got much better.

152
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:38,879
professional animation got much better.
 

153
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,229
professional animation got much better.
So if you're talking about like a hiring

154
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:40,239
So if you're talking about like a hiring
 

155
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,630
So if you're talking about like a hiring
standpoint, doing freelance, whatever,

156
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:42,640
standpoint, doing freelance, whatever,
 

157
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,030
standpoint, doing freelance, whatever,
my work got way better because I used

158
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,040
my work got way better because I used
 

159
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,030
my work got way better because I used
geometry nodes. So when should you start

160
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:47,040
geometry nodes. So when should you start
 

161
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,710
geometry nodes. So when should you start
learning it? So you're just now using

162
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:48,720
learning it? So you're just now using
 

163
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,670
learning it? So you're just now using
Blender and I recommend start learning

164
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:51,680
Blender and I recommend start learning
 

165
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,990
Blender and I recommend start learning
all of the big pieces of the program.

166
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,000
all of the big pieces of the program.
 

167
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,750
all of the big pieces of the program.
Things like the modifier system,

168
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:55,760
Things like the modifier system,
 

169
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,589
Things like the modifier system,
particles and hair systems,

170
00:02:57,589 --> 00:02:57,599
particles and hair systems,
 

171
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,470
particles and hair systems,
polymodeling, weight paint, all of these

172
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:00,480
polymodeling, weight paint, all of these
 

173
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,910
polymodeling, weight paint, all of these
interesting things that all together

174
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:01,920
interesting things that all together
 

175
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,149
interesting things that all together
help you build whatever the things that

176
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:04,159
help you build whatever the things that
 

177
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,589
help you build whatever the things that
you want to build in the program. Get

178
00:03:05,589 --> 00:03:05,599
you want to build in the program. Get
 

179
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,630
you want to build in the program. Get
pretty proficient at them. You don't

180
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:06,640
pretty proficient at them. You don't
 

181
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,229
pretty proficient at them. You don't
have to be a pro. You don't even have to

182
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:08,239
have to be a pro. You don't even have to
 

183
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,869
have to be a pro. You don't even have to
be like a really proficient amateur.

184
00:03:10,869 --> 00:03:10,879
be like a really proficient amateur.
 

185
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,030
be like a really proficient amateur.
Just understand them and get to a point

186
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,040
Just understand them and get to a point
 

187
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,270
Just understand them and get to a point
where you're not relying on tutorials in

188
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:15,280
where you're not relying on tutorials in
 

189
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,550
where you're not relying on tutorials in
order to make the things that you are

190
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:16,560
order to make the things that you are
 

191
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,869
order to make the things that you are
coming up with in your head or wanting

192
00:03:18,869 --> 00:03:18,879
coming up with in your head or wanting
 

193
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,270
coming up with in your head or wanting
to see and do from your references. I'd

194
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:21,280
to see and do from your references. I'd
 

195
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,190
to see and do from your references. I'd
say once you're at that point, I think

196
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,200
say once you're at that point, I think
 

197
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,550
say once you're at that point, I think
you will have enough knowledge to

198
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:24,560
you will have enough knowledge to
 

199
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,750
you will have enough knowledge to
comfortably step into using geometry

200
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:27,760
comfortably step into using geometry
 

201
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,430
comfortably step into using geometry
nodes. Okay. So, if you are a beginner

202
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:29,440
nodes. Okay. So, if you are a beginner
 

203
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,149
nodes. Okay. So, if you are a beginner
in geometry nodes, how would I recommend

204
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:32,159
in geometry nodes, how would I recommend
 

205
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,830
in geometry nodes, how would I recommend
you structure how to learn this program?

206
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:35,840
you structure how to learn this program?
 

207
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,670
you structure how to learn this program?
because it can be very very complicated.

208
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:37,680
because it can be very very complicated.
 

209
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,750
because it can be very very complicated.
Now, like I said, getting really good at

210
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:39,760
Now, like I said, getting really good at
 

211
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,750
Now, like I said, getting really good at
Blender and learning all of the bigger

212
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:41,760
Blender and learning all of the bigger
 

213
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,270
Blender and learning all of the bigger
basic tools, I think, is really

214
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:43,280
basic tools, I think, is really
 

215
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,630
basic tools, I think, is really
important before you start learning

216
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:44,640
important before you start learning
 

217
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,509
important before you start learning
geometry nodes. Mostly because I like to

218
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:47,519
geometry nodes. Mostly because I like to
 

219
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,350
geometry nodes. Mostly because I like to
look at the beginning portion of

220
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:49,360
look at the beginning portion of
 

221
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,589
look at the beginning portion of
learning geometry nodes as a way to

222
00:03:51,589 --> 00:03:51,599
learning geometry nodes as a way to
 

223
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,470
learning geometry nodes as a way to
replace those tasks that we used to do

224
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:54,480
replace those tasks that we used to do
 

225
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,550
replace those tasks that we used to do
outside of geometry nodes that sometimes

226
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:56,560
outside of geometry nodes that sometimes
 

227
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,070
outside of geometry nodes that sometimes
aren't procedural. things like

228
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,080
aren't procedural. things like
 

229
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,949
aren't procedural. things like
displacement, face selection, boolean,

230
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:00,959
displacement, face selection, boolean,
 

231
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,949
displacement, face selection, boolean,
wireframe, all of those things can

232
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:02,959
wireframe, all of those things can
 

233
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,270
wireframe, all of those things can
actually be done within the geometry

234
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:05,280
actually be done within the geometry
 

235
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,350
actually be done within the geometry
nodes workspace, keeping them in that

236
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:07,360
nodes workspace, keeping them in that
 

237
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,270
nodes workspace, keeping them in that
same workspace. And they're all

238
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:09,280
same workspace. And they're all
 

239
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,670
same workspace. And they're all
procedural and way more powerful done

240
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:11,680
procedural and way more powerful done
 

241
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,429
procedural and way more powerful done
within geometry nodes rather than

242
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:13,439
within geometry nodes rather than
 

243
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,390
within geometry nodes rather than
outside using other tools. So with that

244
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:16,400
outside using other tools. So with that
 

245
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,949
outside using other tools. So with that
idea, it's a great way to structure how

246
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:18,959
idea, it's a great way to structure how
 

247
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,030
idea, it's a great way to structure how
you research your daily learning.

248
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:21,040
you research your daily learning.
 

249
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,950
you research your daily learning.
There's two ways to kind of learn

250
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:22,960
There's two ways to kind of learn
 

251
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,030
There's two ways to kind of learn
Blender. You're watching tutorials,

252
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:25,040
Blender. You're watching tutorials,
 

253
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,749
Blender. You're watching tutorials,
courses, you know, video format of

254
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:27,759
courses, you know, video format of
 

255
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,670
courses, you know, video format of
learning. You're watching someone show

256
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:29,680
learning. You're watching someone show
 

257
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,350
learning. You're watching someone show
you how to make a thing. And in this

258
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:31,360
you how to make a thing. And in this
 

259
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,710
you how to make a thing. And in this
case, you're watching geometry notes

260
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:32,720
case, you're watching geometry notes
 

261
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,350
case, you're watching geometry notes
tutorials. The other way, which is just

262
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:35,360
tutorials. The other way, which is just
 

263
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,430
tutorials. The other way, which is just
googling and researching things. So,

264
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:37,440
googling and researching things. So,
 

265
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,030
googling and researching things. So,
since we have this structure of, okay, I

266
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:39,040
since we have this structure of, okay, I
 

267
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,469
since we have this structure of, okay, I
want to make a wireframe or I want to do

268
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:40,479
want to make a wireframe or I want to do
 

269
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,430
want to make a wireframe or I want to do
a displacement, you'll look up how to do

270
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:43,440
a displacement, you'll look up how to do
 

271
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,430
a displacement, you'll look up how to do
displacement in geometry nodes and you

272
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:45,440
displacement in geometry nodes and you
 

273
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,110
displacement in geometry nodes and you
will probably go on Reddit and you will

274
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,120
will probably go on Reddit and you will
 

275
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,270
will probably go on Reddit and you will
find a screenshot of a node tree. I

276
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:49,280
find a screenshot of a node tree. I
 

277
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,030
find a screenshot of a node tree. I
think as a beginner, there's absolutely

278
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:51,040
think as a beginner, there's absolutely
 

279
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,110
think as a beginner, there's absolutely
nothing wrong with looking at a

280
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:53,120
nothing wrong with looking at a
 

281
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,870
nothing wrong with looking at a
screenshot of a node tree and going,

282
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:54,880
screenshot of a node tree and going,
 

283
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,629
screenshot of a node tree and going,
"Okay, let me just copy what they're

284
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:56,639
"Okay, let me just copy what they're
 

285
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,270
"Okay, let me just copy what they're
doing and then see how that works." That

286
00:04:59,270 --> 00:04:59,280
doing and then see how that works." That
 

287
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,950
doing and then see how that works." That
is what almost everyone who's good at

288
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:00,960
is what almost everyone who's good at
 

289
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,710
is what almost everyone who's good at
geometry nodes has done at a certain

290
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:02,720
geometry nodes has done at a certain
 

291
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,710
geometry nodes has done at a certain
point. And even if you're doing it and

292
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:04,720
point. And even if you're doing it and
 

293
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,870
point. And even if you're doing it and
you don't know why each node does what,

294
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:06,880
you don't know why each node does what,
 

295
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,550
you don't know why each node does what,
still do it. I think it's very

296
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:08,560
still do it. I think it's very
 

297
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,469
still do it. I think it's very
beneficial to just get repetition going

298
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:10,479
beneficial to just get repetition going
 

299
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,230
beneficial to just get repetition going
and learning all these nodes and how

300
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:12,240
and learning all these nodes and how
 

301
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,469
and learning all these nodes and how
they work together. Once you do that a

302
00:05:14,469 --> 00:05:14,479
they work together. Once you do that a
 

303
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,070
they work together. Once you do that a
bunch of times, you will start getting

304
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,080
bunch of times, you will start getting
 

305
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,070
bunch of times, you will start getting
it along with watching courses and

306
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,080
it along with watching courses and
 

307
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,830
it along with watching courses and
tutorials. So, with that idea of going,

308
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:19,840
tutorials. So, with that idea of going,
 

309
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,510
tutorials. So, with that idea of going,
okay, well, I probably will be looking

310
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:21,520
okay, well, I probably will be looking
 

311
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,029
okay, well, I probably will be looking
at a lot of screenshots of node trees

312
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:23,039
at a lot of screenshots of node trees
 

313
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,150
at a lot of screenshots of node trees
that I don't understand, but I'm going

314
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:24,160
that I don't understand, but I'm going
 

315
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,189
that I don't understand, but I'm going
to copy them and I'm going to learn how

316
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:25,199
to copy them and I'm going to learn how
 

317
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,430
to copy them and I'm going to learn how
to use them. In this video, I want to

318
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:27,440
to use them. In this video, I want to
 

319
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,670
to use them. In this video, I want to
provide a ton of those screenshots of

320
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:29,680
provide a ton of those screenshots of
 

321
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,909
provide a ton of those screenshots of
those basic tasks like displacement and

322
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:31,919
those basic tasks like displacement and
 

323
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,469
those basic tasks like displacement and
booleans and wireframes and all of that.

324
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:34,479
booleans and wireframes and all of that.
 

325
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,310
booleans and wireframes and all of that.
So, so let's look at how a bunch of

326
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:36,320
So, so let's look at how a bunch of
 

327
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,110
So, so let's look at how a bunch of
those tasks work and the project files I

328
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:39,120
those tasks work and the project files I
 

329
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,029
those tasks work and the project files I
am going to give you guys for completely

them up if you ever need sort of a cheat

340
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:50,000
them up if you ever need sort of a cheat
 

341
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,070
them up if you ever need sort of a cheat
code or, you know, a cheat list of how

342
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,080
code or, you know, a cheat list of how
 

343
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,830
code or, you know, a cheat list of how
to do certain things when you are

344
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:53,840
to do certain things when you are
 

345
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,670
to do certain things when you are
starting to learn the program. So, let

346
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:55,680
starting to learn the program. So, let
 

347
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,510
starting to learn the program. So, let
me show you how a lot of those basic

348
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:57,520
me show you how a lot of those basic
 

349
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,029
me show you how a lot of those basic
tools are made. All right, let's start

350
00:05:59,029 --> 00:05:59,039
tools are made. All right, let's start
 

351
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,950
tools are made. All right, let's start
with something we all know, an array.

352
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:00,960
with something we all know, an array.
 

353
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,629
with something we all know, an array.
These nodes make an array. There's

354
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:02,639
These nodes make an array. There's
 

355
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,670
These nodes make an array. There's
actually a couple ways to do that in

356
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:03,680
actually a couple ways to do that in
 

357
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,670
actually a couple ways to do that in
geometry nodes, but it starts with just

358
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:05,680
geometry nodes, but it starts with just
 

359
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,270
geometry nodes, but it starts with just
a line that has five places to add an

360
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:09,280
a line that has five places to add an
 

361
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,029
a line that has five places to add an
object. And then when we plug them all

362
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:11,039
object. And then when we plug them all
 

363
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,710
object. And then when we plug them all
together, we get an array that allows

364
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:12,720
together, we get an array that allows
 

365
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,790
together, we get an array that allows
you to have some customizability. So

366
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:14,800
you to have some customizability. So
 

367
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,350
you to have some customizability. So
play around with all of these nodes and

368
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:17,360
play around with all of these nodes and
 

369
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,990
play around with all of these nodes and
see what happens. And then obviously you

370
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,000
see what happens. And then obviously you
 

371
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,909
see what happens. And then obviously you
can play with the object that we are

372
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:21,919
can play with the object that we are
 

373
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,390
can play with the object that we are
arraying as well. So this is a group of

374
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:24,400
arraying as well. So this is a group of
 

375
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,950
arraying as well. So this is a group of
random cubes that I have set up to show

376
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:26,960
random cubes that I have set up to show
 

377
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,270
random cubes that I have set up to show
you how booleans work. Now if I mute the

378
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:29,280
you how booleans work. Now if I mute the
 

379
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,110
you how booleans work. Now if I mute the
boolean, this is all of the

380
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:31,120
boolean, this is all of the
 

381
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,950
boolean, this is all of the
intersection. We have all of these

382
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:32,960
intersection. We have all of these
 

383
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,950
intersection. We have all of these
objects right here that are intersecting

384
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:34,960
objects right here that are intersecting
 

385
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,070
objects right here that are intersecting
together. And if looking at the

386
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,080
together. And if looking at the
 

387
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,870
together. And if looking at the
wireframe, we're going oh okay. So when

388
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:38,880
wireframe, we're going oh okay. So when
 

389
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,629
wireframe, we're going oh okay. So when
you're in a situation geometry nodes

390
00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:40,639
you're in a situation geometry nodes
 

391
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,830
you're in a situation geometry nodes
where you have things intersecting and

392
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:41,840
where you have things intersecting and
 

393
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,909
where you have things intersecting and
you want them to boolean very simple

394
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:43,919
you want them to boolean very simple
 

395
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,430
you want them to boolean very simple
it's a mesh boolean node. It's going to

396
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:45,440
it's a mesh boolean node. It's going to
 

397
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,350
it's a mesh boolean node. It's going to
boolean them. It works pretty quick.

398
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:47,360
boolean them. It works pretty quick.
 

399
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,270
boolean them. It works pretty quick.
Depending on the amount of geometry in

400
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:49,280
Depending on the amount of geometry in
 

401
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,350
Depending on the amount of geometry in
your scene and I will also recommend I

402
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:51,360
your scene and I will also recommend I
 

403
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,950
your scene and I will also recommend I
will also recommend that booleans work

404
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:52,960
will also recommend that booleans work
 

405
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,790
will also recommend that booleans work
better if the objects are at varying

406
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:54,800
better if the objects are at varying
 

407
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,230
better if the objects are at varying
heights. If they're all the same height

408
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:56,240
heights. If they're all the same height
 

409
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,909
heights. If they're all the same height
it's not really going to work quite as

410
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:57,919
it's not really going to work quite as
 

411
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,670
it's not really going to work quite as
well. At least not in geometry nodes.

412
00:06:59,670 --> 00:06:59,680
well. At least not in geometry nodes.
 

413
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,150
well. At least not in geometry nodes.
But this is booleans. Very common thing

414
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:02,160
But this is booleans. Very common thing
 

415
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,430
But this is booleans. Very common thing
to come across when you're building

416
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:03,440
to come across when you're building
 

417
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,550
to come across when you're building
things. We need to displace. This is the

418
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:06,560
things. We need to displace. This is the
 

419
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,430
things. We need to displace. This is the
set of weirdness to make displacement.

420
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:09,440
set of weirdness to make displacement.
 

421
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,830
set of weirdness to make displacement.
You have this multiply node to show,

422
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:11,840
You have this multiply node to show,
 

423
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,350
You have this multiply node to show,
hey, this is strength, which this is a

424
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:13,360
hey, this is strength, which this is a
 

425
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,670
hey, this is strength, which this is a
perfect way to understand math. Multiply

426
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:15,680
perfect way to understand math. Multiply
 

427
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,670
perfect way to understand math. Multiply
node if you're not familiar. Multiply

428
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:17,680
node if you're not familiar. Multiply
 

429
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,749
node if you're not familiar. Multiply
just really says the strength of the

430
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:19,759
just really says the strength of the
 

431
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,670
just really says the strength of the
effect either uh less or more of it. And

432
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:23,680
effect either uh less or more of it. And
 

433
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,270
effect either uh less or more of it. And
you can apply this to different pieces

434
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:25,280
you can apply this to different pieces
 

435
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,309
you can apply this to different pieces
of geometry and it will get you a noise

436
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:28,319
of geometry and it will get you a noise
 

437
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,350
of geometry and it will get you a noise
texture displacing the object. Extruding

438
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:31,360
texture displacing the object. Extruding
 

439
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,189
texture displacing the object. Extruding
is fun. And I also made it randomly

440
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:33,199
is fun. And I also made it randomly
 

441
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,670
is fun. And I also made it randomly
extrude with a random value node. But of

442
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:35,680
extrude with a random value node. But of
 

443
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,430
extrude with a random value node. But of
course, we have just a regular

444
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:37,440
course, we have just a regular
 

445
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,350
course, we have just a regular
icosphere. And then if we go ahead and

446
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:39,360
icosphere. And then if we go ahead and
 

447
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,350
icosphere. And then if we go ahead and
bring an extrude mesh node, it'll

448
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:41,360
bring an extrude mesh node, it'll
 

449
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,350
bring an extrude mesh node, it'll
extrude it however we want. And then

450
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:43,360
extrude it however we want. And then
 

451
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,430
extrude it however we want. And then
this fun little magic randomness node

452
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:45,440
this fun little magic randomness node
 

453
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,510
this fun little magic randomness node
goes, hey, randomize it. And you can

454
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:47,520
goes, hey, randomize it. And you can
 

455
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,150
goes, hey, randomize it. And you can
have a lot of fun with randomizing the

456
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,160
have a lot of fun with randomizing the
 

457
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,390
have a lot of fun with randomizing the
extrusion of whatever faces you're

458
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:52,400
extrusion of whatever faces you're
 

459
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,070
extrusion of whatever faces you're
dealing with in geometry nodes. Now,

460
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:54,080
dealing with in geometry nodes. Now,
 

461
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,230
dealing with in geometry nodes. Now,
insetting faces is actually kind of

462
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:56,240
insetting faces is actually kind of
 

463
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,629
insetting faces is actually kind of
weird and complicated. So, let's just do

464
00:07:58,629 --> 00:07:58,639
weird and complicated. So, let's just do
 

465
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,950
weird and complicated. So, let's just do
it right now. So, you have an icosphere

466
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:00,960
it right now. So, you have an icosphere
 

467
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,710
it right now. So, you have an icosphere
and I want to insert those faces. Well,

468
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:02,720
and I want to insert those faces. Well,
 

469
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,110
and I want to insert those faces. Well,
first we're going to use an extrude mesh

470
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:05,120
first we're going to use an extrude mesh
 

471
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,790
first we're going to use an extrude mesh
node. Now, if we were to extrude it like

472
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:06,800
node. Now, if we were to extrude it like
 

473
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,710
node. Now, if we were to extrude it like
we did a minute ago, it's going to do

474
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:08,720
we did a minute ago, it's going to do
 

475
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,830
we did a minute ago, it's going to do
that. I'm actually going to bring the

476
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:09,840
that. I'm actually going to bring the
 

477
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,990
that. I'm actually going to bring the
offset to zero. So, it looks like

478
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,000
offset to zero. So, it looks like
 

479
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,189
offset to zero. So, it looks like
there's no extrusion, but there's

480
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:13,199
there's no extrusion, but there's
 

481
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,670
there's no extrusion, but there's
actually a secondary face that we

482
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:15,680
actually a secondary face that we
 

483
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,510
actually a secondary face that we
created that we can access with this

484
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:17,520
created that we can access with this
 

485
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,869
created that we can access with this
thing right here. So, what we'll do is

486
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:18,879
thing right here. So, what we'll do is
 

487
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,550
thing right here. So, what we'll do is
we'll get a scale elements node. And

488
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:20,560
we'll get a scale elements node. And
 

489
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,070
we'll get a scale elements node. And
right now, it's just going to scale the

490
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,080
right now, it's just going to scale the
 

491
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,230
right now, it's just going to scale the
entire object. I want it to only scale

492
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:24,240
entire object. I want it to only scale
 

493
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,150
entire object. I want it to only scale
that new face, the one that extruded

494
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:26,160
that new face, the one that extruded
 

495
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,150
that new face, the one that extruded
out. I just want to scale that. So, I'll

496
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:28,160
out. I just want to scale that. So, I'll
 

497
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,150
out. I just want to scale that. So, I'll
plug that into the selection. And now

498
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:30,160
plug that into the selection. And now
 

499
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,230
plug that into the selection. And now
you're seeing

500
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:32,240
you're seeing
 

501
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,389
you're seeing
this insetting happening. You can see it

502
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:34,399
this insetting happening. You can see it
 

503
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,469
this insetting happening. You can see it
right there. And if I what I want to do

504
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:36,479
right there. And if I what I want to do
 

505
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,589
right there. And if I what I want to do
is delete that face that we inset. So, I

506
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:39,599
is delete that face that we inset. So, I
 

507
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,070
is delete that face that we inset. So, I
can say only delete that secondary face

508
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:42,080
can say only delete that secondary face
 

509
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,269
can say only delete that secondary face
that we made. So, plug that into the

510
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:43,279
that we made. So, plug that into the
 

511
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,670
that we made. So, plug that into the
selection. And now we have some

512
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:45,680
selection. And now we have some
 

513
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,350
selection. And now we have some
insetting happening. So, it's kind of

514
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:47,360
insetting happening. So, it's kind of
 

515
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,430
insetting happening. So, it's kind of
weird, but geometry nodes can feel weird

516
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:49,440
weird, but geometry nodes can feel weird
 

517
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,110
weird, but geometry nodes can feel weird
quite often. And this is a great example

518
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:51,120
quite often. And this is a great example
 

519
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,030
quite often. And this is a great example
of just like things you just have to

520
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,040
of just like things you just have to
 

521
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,790
of just like things you just have to
rewire the way you think about building

522
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:54,800
rewire the way you think about building
 

523
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,310
rewire the way you think about building
things. Now, there's going to be a time

524
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:56,320
things. Now, there's going to be a time
 

525
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,750
things. Now, there's going to be a time
when you're going to wish you had a

526
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:57,760
when you're going to wish you had a
 

527
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,350
when you're going to wish you had a
texture coordinate system if you're

528
00:08:59,350 --> 00:08:59,360
texture coordinate system if you're
 

529
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,350
texture coordinate system if you're
familiar with shading. So, this system

530
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:01,360
familiar with shading. So, this system
 

531
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,790
familiar with shading. So, this system
of nodes is what we just looked at in

532
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:02,800
of nodes is what we just looked at in
 

533
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,430
of nodes is what we just looked at in
terms of how to displace. If you need

534
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:05,440
terms of how to displace. If you need
 

535
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,389
terms of how to displace. If you need
some mapping, then you'll plug in vector

536
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:08,399
some mapping, then you'll plug in vector
 

537
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,470
some mapping, then you'll plug in vector
math nodes. So, in order to get them to

538
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:10,480
math nodes. So, in order to get them to
 

539
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,509
math nodes. So, in order to get them to
work, I'm going to go ahead and delete

540
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:11,519
work, I'm going to go ahead and delete
 

541
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,070
work, I'm going to go ahead and delete
them and get an a. We'll get vector

542
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:14,080
them and get an a. We'll get vector
 

543
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,230
them and get an a. We'll get vector
math. And I know I'm going to want one

544
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:16,240
math. And I know I'm going to want one
 

545
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,470
math. And I know I'm going to want one
stretch and squash and scale up the

546
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:18,480
stretch and squash and scale up the
 

547
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,670
stretch and squash and scale up the
texture. The other one I just want to be

548
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:19,680
texture. The other one I just want to be
 

549
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,910
texture. The other one I just want to be
able to move it around like a position.

550
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:21,920
able to move it around like a position.
 

551
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,509
able to move it around like a position.
So, we're going to get two vector math

552
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:23,519
So, we're going to get two vector math
 

553
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,430
So, we're going to get two vector math
nodes, but it's not going to work

554
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:25,440
nodes, but it's not going to work
 

555
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,829
nodes, but it's not going to work
because it needs position information.

556
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:27,839
because it needs position information.
 

557
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,150
because it needs position information.
Very easy. We need a position node. So,

558
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,160
Very easy. We need a position node. So,
 

559
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,550
Very easy. We need a position node. So,
plug those into each other, right into

560
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:32,560
plug those into each other, right into
 

561
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,910
plug those into each other, right into
the vector. So, this one I'm just going

562
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:35,920
the vector. So, this one I'm just going
 

563
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,790
the vector. So, this one I'm just going
to have to move on the X and the Y that

564
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:38,800
to have to move on the X and the Y that
 

565
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,030
to have to move on the X and the Y that
texture. And of course, is going up and

566
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,040
texture. And of course, is going up and
 

567
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,990
texture. And of course, is going up and
down. So, you have just this guy moving

568
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:44,000
down. So, you have just this guy moving
 

569
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,829
down. So, you have just this guy moving
around. You can animate. Now, I want

570
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:45,839
around. You can animate. Now, I want
 

571
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,710
around. You can animate. Now, I want
this one set to multiply. What he's

572
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:48,720
this one set to multiply. What he's
 

573
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,030
this one set to multiply. What he's
going to do is actually take the place

574
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,040
going to do is actually take the place
 

575
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,110
going to do is actually take the place
of this multiply in effectively but also

576
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:55,120
of this multiply in effectively but also
 

577
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,190
of this multiply in effectively but also
he is going to squash that texture or we

578
00:09:59,190 --> 00:09:59,200
he is going to squash that texture or we
 

579
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,990
he is going to squash that texture or we
can stretch out this texture using the

580
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,000
can stretch out this texture using the
 

581
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,949
can stretch out this texture using the
multiply as well on the X Y and the Z

582
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:04,959
multiply as well on the X Y and the Z
 

583
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,470
multiply as well on the X Y and the Z
giving you that texture coordinate

584
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:06,480
giving you that texture coordinate
 

585
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,470
giving you that texture coordinate
system that you want. Now selecting

586
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:08,480
system that you want. Now selecting
 

587
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,110
system that you want. Now selecting
individual or groups of faces is going

588
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:11,120
individual or groups of faces is going
 

589
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,190
individual or groups of faces is going
to take a little bit of of of rewiring

590
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:13,200
to take a little bit of of of rewiring
 

591
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,470
to take a little bit of of of rewiring
your brain how you think of it. In

592
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:14,480
your brain how you think of it. In
 

593
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,230
your brain how you think of it. In
geometry nodes you can't just go into

594
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:16,240
geometry nodes you can't just go into
 

595
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,910
geometry nodes you can't just go into
edit mode and go I want this. I'm gonna

596
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:17,920
edit mode and go I want this. I'm gonna
 

597
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,230
edit mode and go I want this. I'm gonna
select this face. Select this face. You

598
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:20,240
select this face. Select this face. You
 

599
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,550
select this face. Select this face. You
have to do it, of course, through nodes

600
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:22,560
have to do it, of course, through nodes
 

601
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,630
have to do it, of course, through nodes
and accessing them. And it's learning.

602
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:24,640
and accessing them. And it's learning.
 

603
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,870
and accessing them. And it's learning.
Every face has a number assigned to it.

604
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:26,880
Every face has a number assigned to it.
 

605
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,910
Every face has a number assigned to it.
And that's called the index. So starts

606
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:29,920
And that's called the index. So starts
 

607
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,710
And that's called the index. So starts
at 0 and 0 1 2 3 4 5 and goes all the

608
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:32,720
at 0 and 0 1 2 3 4 5 and goes all the
 

609
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,470
at 0 and 0 1 2 3 4 5 and goes all the
way up depending on however many faces

610
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:34,480
way up depending on however many faces
 

611
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,829
way up depending on however many faces
you want. If you want to select an

612
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:35,839
you want. If you want to select an
 

613
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,750
you want. If you want to select an
individual one. So using this system of

614
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:39,760
individual one. So using this system of
 

615
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,990
individual one. So using this system of
nodes, it'll allow you to select a face.

616
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:42,000
nodes, it'll allow you to select a face.
 

617
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,470
nodes, it'll allow you to select a face.
In this case, I told it I want to select

618
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:44,480
In this case, I told it I want to select
 

619
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,030
In this case, I told it I want to select
face number 24. So I'm saying using a

620
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,040
face number 24. So I'm saying using a
 

621
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,910
face number 24. So I'm saying using a
math node I want to access indexes. He

622
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:49,920
math node I want to access indexes. He
 

623
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,829
math node I want to access indexes. He
just is another way of using integers

624
00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:51,839
just is another way of using integers
 

625
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,509
just is another way of using integers
instead of that. We're selecting

626
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:53,519
instead of that. We're selecting
 

627
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,110
instead of that. We're selecting
different faces based on their number.

628
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:55,120
different faces based on their number.
 

629
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,269
different faces based on their number.
And then it has this fun little epsilon

630
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:57,279
And then it has this fun little epsilon
 

631
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,430
And then it has this fun little epsilon
or espelon to get the ones around it

632
00:10:59,430 --> 00:10:59,440
or espelon to get the ones around it
 

633
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,110
or espelon to get the ones around it
too. So there's actually once you get

634
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:01,120
too. So there's actually once you get
 

635
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,350
too. So there's actually once you get
into this there's a different lots of

636
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:03,360
into this there's a different lots of
 

637
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,550
into this there's a different lots of
different ways to go about selecting

638
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,560
different ways to go about selecting
 

639
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,110
different ways to go about selecting
faces. This is the sort of the beginning

640
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:07,120
faces. This is the sort of the beginning
 

641
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,870
faces. This is the sort of the beginning
thought process of doing it. The very

642
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:08,880
thought process of doing it. The very
 

643
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,430
thought process of doing it. The very
basic singular face way of doing it. and

644
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:11,440
basic singular face way of doing it. and
 

645
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,150
basic singular face way of doing it. and
knowing, okay, faces have indexes,

646
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,160
knowing, okay, faces have indexes,
 

647
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,750
knowing, okay, faces have indexes,
points have indexes, all of these

648
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:15,760
points have indexes, all of these
 

649
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,590
points have indexes, all of these
indexes you'll have to be able to learn

650
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:17,600
indexes you'll have to be able to learn
 

651
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,590
indexes you'll have to be able to learn
how to access. And the last one is

652
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:19,600
how to access. And the last one is
 

653
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,030
how to access. And the last one is
something I've done over and over and

654
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,040
something I've done over and over and
 

655
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,150
something I've done over and over and
over on the channel just because

656
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:22,160
over on the channel just because
 

657
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,389
over on the channel just because
wireframes are really used quite often

658
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:24,399
wireframes are really used quite often
 

659
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,470
wireframes are really used quite often
in motion graphics. It's just this fun

660
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:26,480
in motion graphics. It's just this fun
 

661
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,550
in motion graphics. It's just this fun
little string of nodes. If we go ahead

662
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:28,560
little string of nodes. If we go ahead
 

663
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,990
little string of nodes. If we go ahead
and delete them all, we can look at how

664
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,000
and delete them all, we can look at how
 

665
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,990
and delete them all, we can look at how
it works. So, you just have an icosphere

666
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,000
it works. So, you just have an icosphere
 

667
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,990
it works. So, you just have an icosphere
here, and then I'm going to convert it

668
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,000
here, and then I'm going to convert it
 

669
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,150
here, and then I'm going to convert it
to curves like that. Now we need to

670
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,160
to curves like that. Now we need to
 

671
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,949
to curves like that. Now we need to
convert it back to a mesh and then use a

672
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:38,959
convert it back to a mesh and then use a
 

673
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,430
convert it back to a mesh and then use a
curved circle to say how wide that tube

674
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:41,440
curved circle to say how wide that tube
 

675
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,750
curved circle to say how wide that tube
is going to be. Now we have a wireframe.

676
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:43,760
is going to be. Now we have a wireframe.
 

677
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,430
is going to be. Now we have a wireframe.
That is all a bunch of little systems

678
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:45,440
That is all a bunch of little systems
 

679
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,350
That is all a bunch of little systems
that as a beginner you're probably going

680
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:47,360

681
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,030
that as a beginner you're probably going
to want to know how to do in order to

683
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,710
to want to know how to do in order to
build things that you want to build. So

684
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:50,720
build things that you want to build. So
 

685
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,069
