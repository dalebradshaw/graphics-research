like you have a cube with a principled

124
00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:09,119
like you have a cube with a principled
 

125
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,210
like you have a cube with a principled
volume on it let's go ahead and type in

126
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:11,220
volume on it let's go ahead and type in
 

127
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,750
volume on it let's go ahead and type in
volume again and get volume to mesh now

128
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:14,760
volume again and get volume to mesh now
 

129
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,970
volume again and get volume to mesh now
we have kind of a beveled Cube

130
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:16,980
we have kind of a beveled Cube
 

131
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,070
we have kind of a beveled Cube
so if you've never used the volume Cube

132
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:19,080
so if you've never used the volume Cube
 

133
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,050
so if you've never used the volume Cube
before it's a fun little tool you can

134
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:21,060
before it's a fun little tool you can
 

135
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,110
before it's a fun little tool you can
make this really cool volume Cube and

136
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:23,120
make this really cool volume Cube and
 

137
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,550
make this really cool volume Cube and
it's there's not a lot to it to be

138
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:25,560
it's there's not a lot to it to be
 

139
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,350
it's there's not a lot to it to be
honest and I have made a video on it in

140
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:27,360
honest and I have made a video on it in
 

141
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,330
honest and I have made a video on it in
the past but really the most important

142
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:29,340
the past but really the most important
 

143
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,770
the past but really the most important
thing to know in this tutorial for the

144
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:30,780
thing to know in this tutorial for the
 

145
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,970
thing to know in this tutorial for the
volume cube is right over here is your

146
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:31,980
volume cube is right over here is your
 

147
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,729
volume cube is right over here is your
resolution so if you click and drag it

148
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:34,739
resolution so if you click and drag it
 

149
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:36,949
resolution so if you click and drag it
will up your resolution so now you just

150
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:36,959
will up your resolution so now you just
 

151
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,809
will up your resolution so now you just
have massive amount of faces so if we go

152
00:02:38,809 --> 00:02:38,819
have massive amount of faces so if we go
 

153
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:40,369
have massive amount of faces so if we go
to the wireframe view you can see that

154
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:40,379
to the wireframe view you can see that
 

155
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:42,830
to the wireframe view you can see that
if I click and drag and bring it back

156
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:42,840
if I click and drag and bring it back
 

157
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,290
if I click and drag and bring it back
this is your subdivision for the cube so

158
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:45,300
this is your subdivision for the cube so
 

159
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,430
this is your subdivision for the cube so
that's really important to note I'm

160
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:46,440
that's really important to note I'm
 

161
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,930
that's really important to note I'm
going to keep mine at 50 for now but

162
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:47,940
going to keep mine at 50 for now but
 

163
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,449
going to keep mine at 50 for now but
we're going to render it at 100. or

164
00:02:50,449 --> 00:02:50,459
we're going to render it at 100. or
 

165
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:52,070
we're going to render it at 100. or
really whenever your computer can handle

166
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:52,080
really whenever your computer can handle
 

167
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,449
really whenever your computer can handle
sometimes you can't sometimes you can

168
00:02:53,449 --> 00:02:53,459
sometimes you can't sometimes you can
 

169
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:54,470
sometimes you can't sometimes you can
handle more

170
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:54,480
handle more
 

171
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,270
handle more
now with that being said

172
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:56,280
now with that being said
 

173
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,890
now with that being said
we want to turn this into a circle and

174
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:57,900
we want to turn this into a circle and
 

175
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,509
we want to turn this into a circle and
there's no there's not a volume Circle

176
00:02:59,509 --> 00:02:59,519
there's no there's not a volume Circle
 

177
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,250
there's no there's not a volume Circle
there's not a volume Taurus there's just

178
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:01,260
there's not a volume Taurus there's just
 

179
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,110
there's not a volume Taurus there's just
a volume Cube so what we need to do is

180
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:03,120
a volume Cube so what we need to do is
 

181
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,570
a volume Cube so what we need to do is
get a gradient node

182
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:05,580
get a gradient node
 

183
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,850
get a gradient node
gradient texture and go to spherical and

184
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:07,860
gradient texture and go to spherical and
 

185
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,589
gradient texture and go to spherical and
that is just going to go ahead and turn

186
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:09,599
that is just going to go ahead and turn
 

187
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,050
that is just going to go ahead and turn
it into a circle which is pretty neat

188
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:12,060
it into a circle which is pretty neat
 

189
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,930
it into a circle which is pretty neat
very simple let's go ahead and smooth it

190
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:14,940
very simple let's go ahead and smooth it
 

191
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,410
very simple let's go ahead and smooth it
out with a set shade smooth node that's

192
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:18,420
out with a set shade smooth node that's
 

193
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,790
out with a set shade smooth node that's
all we're going to need to do that but

194
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:19,800
all we're going to need to do that but
 

195
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,949
all we're going to need to do that but
now we need to take a noise texture and

196
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:21,959
now we need to take a noise texture and
 

197
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:24,350
now we need to take a noise texture and
kind of destroy this but there's no real

198
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:24,360
kind of destroy this but there's no real
 

199
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,729
kind of destroy this but there's no real
obvious way to do it because we're

200
00:03:25,729 --> 00:03:25,739
obvious way to do it because we're
 

201
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:29,149
obvious way to do it because we're
already using the input to destroy it

202
00:03:29,149 --> 00:03:29,159
already using the input to destroy it
 

203
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:30,830
already using the input to destroy it
typically you just put a noise texture

204
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:30,840
typically you just put a noise texture
 

205
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,690
typically you just put a noise texture
in it and destroy the cube

206
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:32,700
in it and destroy the cube
 

207
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,850
in it and destroy the cube
so this is what we have to do let's go

208
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:34,860
so this is what we have to do let's go
 

209
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,330
so this is what we have to do let's go
ahead and get a mix RGB and we'll plug

210
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:38,340
ahead and get a mix RGB and we'll plug
 

211
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,210
ahead and get a mix RGB and we'll plug
the gradient texture into the factor and

212
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:41,220
the gradient texture into the factor and
 

213
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,369
the gradient texture into the factor and
then bring color one all the way to

214
00:03:43,369 --> 00:03:43,379
then bring color one all the way to
 

215
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:44,449
then bring color one all the way to
Black and that's going to give us our

216
00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:44,459
Black and that's going to give us our
 

217
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:47,270
Black and that's going to give us our
Circle back and we use this output right

218
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:47,280
Circle back and we use this output right
 

219
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,710
Circle back and we use this output right
here to put textures into it

220
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:51,720
here to put textures into it
 

221
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,149
here to put textures into it
the texture we're going to use is a

222
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:53,159
the texture we're going to use is a
 

223
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:55,070
the texture we're going to use is a
noise texture but you can use any

224
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:55,080
noise texture but you can use any
 

225
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,570
noise texture but you can use any
texture you want it's a really really

226
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:56,580
texture you want it's a really really
 

227
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,670
texture you want it's a really really
fun to play with you can even pause the

228
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:58,680
fun to play with you can even pause the
 

229
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,130
fun to play with you can even pause the
tutorial Now find a texture that you

230
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:01,140
tutorial Now find a texture that you
 

231
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,649
tutorial Now find a texture that you
like and goof around with it our scale

232
00:04:03,649 --> 00:04:03,659
like and goof around with it our scale
 

233
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:07,309
like and goof around with it our scale
we're going to do 1.7 on the scale make

234
00:04:07,309 --> 00:04:07,319
we're going to do 1.7 on the scale make
 

235
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:09,110
we're going to do 1.7 on the scale make
sure it's 4D and that's so that we can

236
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,120
sure it's 4D and that's so that we can
 

237
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,690
sure it's 4D and that's so that we can
animate it and then we need to go ahead

238
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:11,700
animate it and then we need to go ahead
 

239
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,390
animate it and then we need to go ahead
and get a color ramp

240
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:14,400
and get a color ramp
 

241
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,949
and get a color ramp
color ramp goes here and that's going to

242
00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:15,959
color ramp goes here and that's going to
 

243
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:18,650
color ramp goes here and that's going to
allow us to eat into this and so when we

244
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:18,660
allow us to eat into this and so when we
 

245
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,949
allow us to eat into this and so when we
play with that W now we have the look

246
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:21,959
play with that W now we have the look
 

247
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,629
play with that W now we have the look
that we're going for this used to be a

248
00:04:23,629 --> 00:04:23,639
that we're going for this used to be a
 

249
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:24,830
that we're going for this used to be a
lot more difficult you'd have to use

250
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:24,840
lot more difficult you'd have to use
 

251
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,249
lot more difficult you'd have to use
like vertex groups and weirdness

252
00:04:27,249 --> 00:04:27,259
like vertex groups and weirdness
 

253
00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:29,629
like vertex groups and weirdness
now with geometry notes it's just super

254
00:04:29,629 --> 00:04:29,639
now with geometry notes it's just super
 

255
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:32,090
now with geometry notes it's just super
easy to do so this is done we can Loop

256
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:32,100
easy to do so this is done we can Loop
 

257
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,350
easy to do so this is done we can Loop
it but we'll go ahead and loop the

258
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:33,360
it but we'll go ahead and loop the
 

259
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,210
it but we'll go ahead and loop the
animation later I want to go ahead and

260
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:35,220
animation later I want to go ahead and
 

261
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,070
animation later I want to go ahead and
build kind of a cage around it now we're

262
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:37,080
build kind of a cage around it now we're
 

263
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,150
build kind of a cage around it now we're
getting the point we can just kind of

264
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:38,160
getting the point we can just kind of
 

265
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,310
getting the point we can just kind of
make this really cool looking

266
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:40,320
make this really cool looking
 

267
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,330
make this really cool looking
um so we're gonna go ahead and get a

268
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:41,340
um so we're gonna go ahead and get a
 

269
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,390
um so we're gonna go ahead and get a
join geometry node

270
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:44,400
join geometry node
 

271
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,129
join geometry node
this is almost like a mixed Shader if

272
00:04:46,129 --> 00:04:46,139
this is almost like a mixed Shader if
 

273
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:48,469
this is almost like a mixed Shader if
you're familiar with nodes node-based

274
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:48,479
you're familiar with nodes node-based
 

275
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:49,430
you're familiar with nodes node-based
shading

276
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:49,440
shading
 

277
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,710
shading
the geometry nodes isn't going to be too

278
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:51,720
the geometry nodes isn't going to be too
 

279
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,270
the geometry nodes isn't going to be too
crazy to understand especially if you're

280
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,280
crazy to understand especially if you're
 

281
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,010
crazy to understand especially if you're
pretty good at node-based shading this

282
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:55,020
pretty good at node-based shading this
 

283
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,350
pretty good at node-based shading this
is essentially a mix Shader what we need

284
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:57,360
is essentially a mix Shader what we need
 

285
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,930
is essentially a mix Shader what we need
to do is get an icosphere

286
00:04:59,930 --> 00:04:59,940
to do is get an icosphere
 

287
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,850
to do is get an icosphere
put that over here and plug that

288
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:01,860
put that over here and plug that
 

289
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,170
put that over here and plug that
straight into the joint geometry you

290
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:03,180
straight into the joint geometry you
 

291
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,390
straight into the joint geometry you
just put it anywhere the uh the order

292
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:05,400
just put it anywhere the uh the order
 

293
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,249
just put it anywhere the uh the order
doesn't matter if it's above or below

294
00:05:07,249 --> 00:05:07,259
doesn't matter if it's above or below
 

295
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:09,830
doesn't matter if it's above or below
them as far as I'm aware now let's go

296
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:09,840
them as far as I'm aware now let's go
 

297
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,909
them as far as I'm aware now let's go
ahead and get in a mesh to curve that's

298
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:13,919
ahead and get in a mesh to curve that's
 

299
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:14,930
ahead and get in a mesh to curve that's
going to turn this into kind of a

300
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:14,940
going to turn this into kind of a
 

301
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,850
going to turn this into kind of a
wireframe and then I'm going to go ahead

302
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:16,860
wireframe and then I'm going to go ahead
 

303
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,370
wireframe and then I'm going to go ahead
and bring my radius down a little bit I

304
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:19,380
and bring my radius down a little bit I
 

305
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:23,390
and bring my radius down a little bit I
like the kind of parasite goo whatever

306
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:23,400
like the kind of parasite goo whatever
 

307
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,689
like the kind of parasite goo whatever
to kind of intersect

308
00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:26,699
to kind of intersect
 

309
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:28,430
to kind of intersect
um the wireframe so it's kind of caged

310
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:28,440
um the wireframe so it's kind of caged
 

311
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,570
um the wireframe so it's kind of caged
in but it's still trying to come out

312
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:29,580
in but it's still trying to come out
 

313
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,430
in but it's still trying to come out
gives it a little bit of a story and now

314
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:31,440
gives it a little bit of a story and now
 

315
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,150
gives it a little bit of a story and now
let's go ahead and get to curve to mesh

316
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:35,160
let's go ahead and get to curve to mesh
 

317
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,110
let's go ahead and get to curve to mesh
curve to mesh put that there and to kind

318
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:39,120
curve to mesh put that there and to kind
 

319
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,670
curve to mesh put that there and to kind
of initiate that we need to get a curved

320
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:40,680
of initiate that we need to get a curved
 

321
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,870
of initiate that we need to get a curved
Circle

322
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:41,880
Circle
 

323
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,029
Circle
so just type in circle and then the

324
00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:44,039
so just type in circle and then the
 

325
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:46,129
so just type in circle and then the
radius is going to dictate

326
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:46,139
radius is going to dictate
 

327
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:48,290
radius is going to dictate
how big that bar is going to be so add

328
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:48,300
how big that bar is going to be so add
 

329
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,330
how big that bar is going to be so add
the curve and then bring that radius

330
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:50,340
the curve and then bring that radius
 

331
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,830
the curve and then bring that radius
down

332
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:51,840
down
 

333
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,689
down
and now we have

334
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:53,699
and now we have
 

335
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:55,909
and now we have
a bit of a cage that this is going to be

336
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:55,919
a bit of a cage that this is going to be
 

337
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,249
a bit of a cage that this is going to be
encapsulated in but I also want to now

338
00:05:58,249 --> 00:05:58,259
encapsulated in but I also want to now
 

339
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:00,770
encapsulated in but I also want to now
add some spheres around each point the

340
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:00,780
add some spheres around each point the
 

341
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,249
add some spheres around each point the
point is kind of the corners so using

342
00:06:04,249 --> 00:06:04,259
point is kind of the corners so using
 

343
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:05,570
point is kind of the corners so using
that word point we need to get an

344
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:05,580
that word point we need to get an
 

345
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,430
that word point we need to get an
instance on point

346
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:07,440
instance on point
 

347
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,850
instance on point
so we'll do a instance on points

348
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:10,860
so we'll do a instance on points
 

349
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,430
so we'll do a instance on points
and we will plug the icosphere into the

350
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:13,440
and we will plug the icosphere into the
 

351
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,770
and we will plug the icosphere into the
points selection so it says use these

352
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:15,780
points selection so it says use these
 

353
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,689
points selection so it says use these
points and we're going to plug an object

354
00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:17,699
points and we're going to plug an object
 

355
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:19,610
points and we're going to plug an object
in the instance as what object we are

356
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:19,620
in the instance as what object we are
 

357
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,930
in the instance as what object we are
going to instance so let's plug this

358
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:20,940
going to instance so let's plug this
 

359
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,150
going to instance so let's plug this
into the genome geometry and let's get

360
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:23,160
into the genome geometry and let's get
 

361
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,090
into the genome geometry and let's get
another icosphere

362
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:26,100

 

363
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,309

all right here icosphere and plug that

364
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:28,319
all right here icosphere and plug that
 

365
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,350
all right here icosphere and plug that
icosphere into the instance

366
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:30,360
icosphere into the instance
 

367
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,550
icosphere into the instance
and then we're going to bring that

368
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:31,560
and then we're going to bring that
 

369
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,890
and then we're going to bring that
radius down so now you can see it's on

370
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:33,900
radius down so now you can see it's on
 

371
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,330
radius down so now you can see it's on
each point which is really really cool

372
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:35,340
each point which is really really cool
 

373
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,150
each point which is really really cool
and then bring those subdivisions up a

374
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:38,160
and then bring those subdivisions up a
 

375
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,770
and then bring those subdivisions up a
little bit on that icosphere you know

376
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:39,780
little bit on that icosphere you know
 

377
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,230
little bit on that icosphere you know
really whatever you want

378
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:42,240
really whatever you want
 

379
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,689
really whatever you want
um and we have it now you can see those

380
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:44,699
um and we have it now you can see those
 

381
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:47,510
um and we have it now you can see those
faces let's go ahead and get that set

382
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,520
faces let's go ahead and get that set
 

383
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,210
faces let's go ahead and get that set

is going to be a seamless Loop so it can
 

429
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,689
is going to be a seamless Loop so it can
be infinite and it won't be obvious so

going to give it a keyframe now if you

462
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:21,720
going to give it a keyframe now if you
 

463
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,450
going to give it a keyframe now if you
click on it you can't see your keyframes

464
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:23,460
click on it you can't see your keyframes
 

465
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,890
click on it you can't see your keyframes
that's normal I don't know why it does

466
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:24,900
that's normal I don't know why it does
 

467
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,270
that's normal I don't know why it does
that but sometimes you just can't see

468
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:26,280
that but sometimes you just can't see
 

469
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,529
that but sometimes you just can't see
your keyframes

470
00:08:27,529 --> 00:08:27,539
your keyframes

so that's going to make your W go to a
 

479
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:38,509
so that's going to make your W go to a
value of one it's going to animate a

480
00:08:38,509 --> 00:08:38,519
value of one it's going to animate a
 

481
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,949
value of one it's going to animate a
little bit if you want your animation to

482
00:08:39,949 --> 00:08:39,959
little bit if you want your animation to
 

483
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:42,649
little bit if you want your animation to
go quicker use two three four five you

484
00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:42,659
go quicker use two three four five you
 

485
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:43,969
go quicker use two three four five you
know however strong you want it to be

486
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:43,979
know however strong you want it to be
 

487
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:46,730
know however strong you want it to be
now that we're at the very end go to

488
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:46,740
now that we're at the very end go to
 

489
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,710
now that we're at the very end go to
this one hover over the W make sure it's

490
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:48,720
this one hover over the W make sure it's
 

491
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,670
this one hover over the W make sure it's
at zero hit I go to the end back to

492
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:52,680
at zero hit I go to the end back to
 

493
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,949
at zero hit I go to the end back to
frame zero and since we use positive one

494
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:54,959
frame zero and since we use positive one
 

495
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,090
frame zero and since we use positive one
on this one

496
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:56,100
on this one
 

497
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,430
on this one
negative one at the very end

498
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:58,440
negative one at the very end
 

499
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,410
negative one at the very end
oops

500
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:00,420
oops
 

501
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,810
oops
delete keyframes there we go negative

502
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:02,820
delete keyframes there we go negative
 

503
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,269
delete keyframes there we go negative
one so now we can see it animates if we

504
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:05,279
one so now we can see it animates if we
 

505
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,250
one so now we can see it animates if we
go to the end it's a perfect Loop and

506
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:07,260
go to the end it's a perfect Loop and
 

507
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,630
go to the end it's a perfect Loop and
again I mentioned if you want to be

508
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:08,640
again I mentioned if you want to be
 

509
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,030
again I mentioned if you want to be
faster don't use a value of one using a

510
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,040
faster don't use a value of one using a
 

511
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,530
faster don't use a value of one using a
value of two and then if you go to the

512
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:12,540
value of two and then if you go to the
 

513
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,750
value of two and then if you go to the
very end make sure this one is negative

514
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:14,760
very end make sure this one is negative
 

515
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,790
very end make sure this one is negative
two so they relate

516
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:16,800
two so they relate
 

517
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,310
two so they relate
but with that being said we now have

518
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:19,320
but with that being said we now have
 

519
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,810
but with that being said we now have
this and if you want to know like what

this and if you want to know like what
 

521
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,210
this and if you want to know like what
would this look like for res

post show whatever so let's build an
 

541
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,030
post show whatever so let's build an
environment around a very simple one

542
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:44,040
environment around a very simple one

00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,410
environment around a very simple one
so I'm gonna hit the tilde key which is

544
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:45,420
so I'm gonna hit the tilde key which is
 

545
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,730
so I'm gonna hit the tilde key which is
right above the Tab Key I'm going to

546
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:46,740
right above the Tab Key I'm going to
 

547
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,870
right above the Tab Key I'm going to
click front

548
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:47,880
click front
 

549
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,150
click front
shift a add a camera and I'm going to

550
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:50,160
shift a add a camera and I'm going to
 

551
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,090
shift a add a camera and I'm going to
hit Ctrl alt 0 that's going to snap that

552
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:53,100
hit Ctrl alt 0 that's going to snap that
 

553
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,730
hit Ctrl alt 0 that's going to snap that
camera to view and say it's like way out

554
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:55,740
camera to view and say it's like way out
 

555
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,610
camera to view and say it's like way out
here or way in here just hit G and

556
00:09:58,610 --> 00:09:58,620
here or way in here just hit G and
 

557
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,610
here or way in here just hit G and
middle click and that'll slide it out

558
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:01,620
middle click and that'll slide it out
 

559
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,650
middle click and that'll slide it out
to where you want it to be there we go

560
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:03,660
to where you want it to be there we go
 

561
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,110
to where you want it to be there we go
look how cool that looks

562
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:06,120
look how cool that looks
 

563
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,170
look how cool that looks
so let's go ahead and build a scene

564
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:09,180
so let's go ahead and build a scene
 

565
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,090
so let's go ahead and build a scene
around this so I'm going to be using

566
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:11,100
around this so I'm going to be using
 

567
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,949
around this so I'm going to be using
Cycles you don't have to use Cycles you

568
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:12,959
Cycles you don't have to use Cycles you
 

569
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,630
Cycles you don't have to use Cycles you
can use EV just really depends on your

570
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:14,640
can use EV just really depends on your
 

571
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,370
can use EV just really depends on your
preference and your Hardware

572
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:16,380
preference and your Hardware
 

573
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,290
preference and your Hardware
so here in the world icon I'm going to

574
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:18,300
so here in the world icon I'm going to
 

575
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,250
so here in the world icon I'm going to
go ahead and bring it all the way down

576
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:19,260
go ahead and bring it all the way down
 

577
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,210
go ahead and bring it all the way down
to Black

578
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:20,220
to Black
 

579
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,009
to Black
and then I want to have a light that's

580
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:22,019
and then I want to have a light that's
 

581
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:24,050
and then I want to have a light that's
really big and behind this so you get a

582
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:24,060
really big and behind this so you get a
 

583
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,569
really big and behind this so you get a
really soft lighting and you also get

584
00:10:26,569 --> 00:10:26,579
really soft lighting and you also get
 

585
00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:28,910
really soft lighting and you also get
some silhouette so I'll go ahead and get

586
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:28,920
some silhouette so I'll go ahead and get
 

587
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,670
some silhouette so I'll go ahead and get
a point light and I'm going to hit G and

588
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:31,680
a point light and I'm going to hit G and
 

589
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,590
a point light and I'm going to hit G and
I'm going to move it

590
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:33,600
I'm going to move it
 

591
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,470
I'm going to move it
here so it's behind and it's up

592
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:36,480
here so it's behind and it's up
 

593
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,569
here so it's behind and it's up
so it really does not to be need to be

594
00:10:38,569 --> 00:10:38,579
so it really does not to be need to be
 

595
00:10:38,579 --> 00:10:40,430
so it really does not to be need to be
an exact science so we're going to go

596
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:40,440
an exact science so we're going to go
 

597
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,769
an exact science so we're going to go
now here to the Cycles view I'm going to

598
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:42,779
now here to the Cycles view I'm going to
 

599
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:45,410
now here to the Cycles view I'm going to
give my power at 10 000.

600
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:45,420
give my power at 10 000.
 

601
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,389
give my power at 10 000.
and that you might say oh that's way too

602
00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:47,399
and that you might say oh that's way too
 

603
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:48,590
and that you might say oh that's way too
bright and that's because we're going to

604
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:48,600
bright and that's because we're going to
 

605
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,269
bright and that's because we're going to
bring this radius

606
00:10:50,269 --> 00:10:50,279
bring this radius
 

607
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:54,110
bring this radius
really high up so now it's super soft

608
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:54,120
really high up so now it's super soft
 

609
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,910
really high up so now it's super soft
um now that we're here let's go ahead

610
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:55,920
um now that we're here let's go ahead
 

611
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,590
um now that we're here let's go ahead
and add the volume so go to the World

612
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:57,600
and add the volume so go to the World
 

613
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,530
and add the volume so go to the World
Properties volume right here in volume

614
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:00,540
Properties volume right here in volume
 

615
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,630
Properties volume right here in volume
go to principled volume

616
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:02,640
go to principled volume
 

617
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,889
go to principled volume
now it's going to take everything away

618
00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:03,899
now it's going to take everything away
 

619
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:07,430
now it's going to take everything away
right here in your density 0.01

620
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:07,440
right here in your density 0.01
 

621
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,470
right here in your density 0.01
on the point light setting so click on

622
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:09,480
on the point light setting so click on
 

623
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,030
on the point light setting so click on
your point light go to the settings make

624
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,040
your point light go to the settings make
 

625
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,730
your point light go to the settings make
it whatever color you want I love a

626
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:13,740
it whatever color you want I love a
 

627
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,150
it whatever color you want I love a
slight blue now we're here let's go

628
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:17,160
slight blue now we're here let's go
 

629
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,370
slight blue now we're here let's go
ahead and add materials to this

630
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:19,380
ahead and add materials to this
 

631
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,170
ahead and add materials to this
in Geometry nodes it's a little bit

632
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:21,180
in Geometry nodes it's a little bit
 

633
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,050
in Geometry nodes it's a little bit
weirder to make to add materials you

634
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:24,060
weirder to make to add materials you
 

635
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,190
weirder to make to add materials you
can't just add them the typical

636
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:25,200
can't just add them the typical
 

637
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,690
can't just add them the typical
traditional way

638
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:26,700
traditional way
 

639
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,449
traditional way
so go here to this join geometry each of

640
00:11:29,449 --> 00:11:29,459
so go here to this join geometry each of
 

641
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:31,430
so go here to this join geometry each of
these strings represents a piece of this

642
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:31,440
these strings represents a piece of this
 

643
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,509
these strings represents a piece of this
pie in a sense so this string is the goo

644
00:11:34,509 --> 00:11:34,519
pie in a sense so this string is the goo
 

645
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:37,190
pie in a sense so this string is the goo
this string here would be the wireframe

646
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:37,200
this string here would be the wireframe
 

647
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,750
this string here would be the wireframe
and this string here would be those

648
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:38,760
and this string here would be those
 

649
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,210
and this string here would be those
spheres on each point so we need to add

650
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:41,220
spheres on each point so we need to add
 

651
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,389
spheres on each point so we need to add
a set material node

652
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:44,399
a set material node
 

653
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,630
a set material node
so set material and then shift d

654
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:47,640
so set material and then shift d
 

655
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,970
so set material and then shift d
plop them on each side now we need two

656
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:49,980
plop them on each side now we need two
 

657
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,150
plop them on each side now we need two
materials we need the goo that's a

00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:53,160
materials we need the goo that's a
 

659
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,850
materials we need the goo that's a
glowing goo and the kind of basic

I'll click another one and we're going
 

669
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,870
I'll click another one and we're going
to call it base

670
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:05,880
to call it base
 

671
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,370
to call it base
the reason why we're titling them is

672
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:07,380
the reason why we're titling them is
 

673
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,750
the reason why we're titling them is
over here you have to be able to see

674
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:08,760
over here you have to be able to see
 

675
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,850
over here you have to be able to see
them so it's more important to tile them

676
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:10,860
them so it's more important to tile them
 

677
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,710
them so it's more important to tile them
I used to never need to dial them let me

678
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:12,720
I used to never need to dial them let me
 

679
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,050
I used to never need to dial them let me
title them with that being said let's go

680
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:15,060
title them with that being said let's go
 

681
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,269
title them with that being said let's go
ahead and click goo here

682
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:17,279
ahead and click goo here
 

683
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,650
ahead and click goo here
base

684
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:18,660
base
 

685
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,889
base
base now let's go here to the shading

686
00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:21,899
base now let's go here to the shading
 

687
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:24,650
base now let's go here to the shading
Tab and work on texturing these guys

688
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:24,660
Tab and work on texturing these guys
 

689
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,050
Tab and work on texturing these guys
shading them whatever term you like to

690
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:27,060
shading them whatever term you like to
 

691
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,129
shading them whatever term you like to
use

692
00:12:28,129 --> 00:12:28,139
use
 

693
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:31,009
use
so we on slot two which is the base keep

694
00:12:31,009 --> 00:12:31,019
so we on slot two which is the base keep
 

695
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:32,990
so we on slot two which is the base keep
that in mind slot one is the goo slot

696
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:33,000
that in mind slot one is the goo slot
 

697
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,870
that in mind slot one is the goo slot
two is the base uh so base color bring

698
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:35,880
two is the base uh so base color bring
 

699
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,090
two is the base uh so base color bring
that to Black and bring your roughness

700
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:38,100
that to Black and bring your roughness
 

701
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,190
that to Black and bring your roughness
almost all the way down now we have this

702
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:40,200
almost all the way down now we have this
 

703
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,030
almost all the way down now we have this
beautiful shiny black material now let's

704
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:44,040
beautiful shiny black material now let's
 

705
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,069
beautiful shiny black material now let's
go here to slot number one which is goo

706
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:46,079
go here to slot number one which is goo
 

707
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,290
go here to slot number one which is goo
we're gonna do the same thing

708
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:48,300
we're gonna do the same thing
 

709
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,329
we're gonna do the same thing
really low roughness bring that specular

710
00:12:50,329 --> 00:12:50,339
really low roughness bring that specular
 

711
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:51,710
really low roughness bring that specular
all the way up so you get really bright

712
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:51,720
all the way up so you get really bright
 

713
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,449
all the way up so you get really bright
Reflections you can even go up to like

714
00:12:53,449 --> 00:12:53,459
Reflections you can even go up to like
 

715
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:55,670
Reflections you can even go up to like
two really bright Reflections you can

716
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:55,680
two really bright Reflections you can
 

717
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,430
two really bright Reflections you can
really force it uh with those values and

718
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:58,440
really force it uh with those values and
 

719
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,110
really force it uh with those values and
then here we need to go add some

720
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:00,120
then here we need to go add some
 

721
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,870
then here we need to go add some
emission so let's get a color ramp

722
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:02,880
emission so let's get a color ramp
 

723
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,850
emission so let's get a color ramp
and we want a smooth gradient so we're

724
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:04,860
and we want a smooth gradient so we're
 

725
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,009
and we want a smooth gradient so we're
going to go to B spline and we need a

726
00:13:07,009 --> 00:13:07,019
going to go to B spline and we need a
 

727
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,629
going to go to B spline and we need a
layer weight

728
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:08,639
layer weight
 

729
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,509
layer weight
layer weight and use the facing

730
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:11,519
layer weight and use the facing
 

731
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,009
layer weight and use the facing
and then plug the color into the

732
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:13,019
and then plug the color into the
 

733
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:15,290
and then plug the color into the
emission

734
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:15,300
emission
 

735
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,690
emission
so now when we play with this blend it's

736
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:17,700
so now when we play with this blend it's
 

737
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,790
so now when we play with this blend it's
going to go back to the edge let's go

738
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:19,800
going to go back to the edge let's go
 

739
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,949
going to go back to the edge let's go
ahead and bring this color ramp in so

740
00:13:21,949 --> 00:13:21,959
ahead and bring this color ramp in so
 

741
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:23,870
ahead and bring this color ramp in so
now we get this effect

742
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:23,880
now we get this effect
 

743
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,790
now we get this effect
the white go ahead and add whatever

744
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:25,800
the white go ahead and add whatever
 

745
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,110
the white go ahead and add whatever
color you want I'm gonna go with green

746
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:27,120
color you want I'm gonna go with green
 

747
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,210
color you want I'm gonna go with green
because it's very sci-fi and

748
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:29,220
because it's very sci-fi and
 

749
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,190
because it's very sci-fi and
you guys know I love the Sci-Fi Styles

750
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:31,200
you guys know I love the Sci-Fi Styles
 

751
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,930
you guys know I love the Sci-Fi Styles
I'm going to go ahead and just remove

752
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:32,940
I'm going to go ahead and just remove
 

753
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,690
I'm going to go ahead and just remove
this background it's just preference and

754
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:35,700
this background it's just preference and
 

755
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,949
this background it's just preference and
then bring that up that emission

756
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:36,959
then bring that up that emission
 

757
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,449
then bring that up that emission
strength and you're going to have

758
00:13:38,449 --> 00:13:38,459
strength and you're going to have
 

759
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:41,509
strength and you're going to have
something crazy I'm gonna go to Cycles

760
00:13:41,509 --> 00:13:41,519
something crazy I'm gonna go to Cycles
 

761
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,850
something crazy I'm gonna go to Cycles
and tweak this a little bit

762
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:43,860
and tweak this a little bit
 

763
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,310
and tweak this a little bit
something like this

764
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:46,320
something like this
 

765
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,170
something like this
bring that emission strength really high

766
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:48,180
bring that emission strength really high
 

767
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,530
bring that emission strength really high
we want to be able to Glow really nicely

768
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:51,540
we want to be able to Glow really nicely
 

769
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,829
we want to be able to Glow really nicely
there we go we have this looks awesome

770
00:13:54,829 --> 00:13:54,839
there we go we have this looks awesome
 

771
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:58,310
there we go we have this looks awesome
looks clean looks nice and our light is

772
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:58,320
looks clean looks nice and our light is
 

773
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,889
looks clean looks nice and our light is
too bright it's because of our uh

774
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:00,899
too bright it's because of our uh
 

775
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:02,569
too bright it's because of our uh
specular so we can bring that specular

776
00:14:02,569 --> 00:14:02,579
specular so we can bring that specular
 

777
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:05,629
specular so we can bring that specular
back to one bring your specular down it

778
00:14:05,629 --> 00:14:05,639
back to one bring your specular down it
 

779
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:07,550
back to one bring your specular down it
really just depends on how you want

780
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:07,560
really just depends on how you want
 

781
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,350
really just depends on how you want
that to look let's bring that specular

782
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:09,360
that to look let's bring that specular
 

783
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,269
that to look let's bring that specular
back to two and bring our light down

784
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:11,279
back to two and bring our light down
 

785
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,769
back to two and bring our light down
might be too bright so let's go five

786
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:12,779
might be too bright so let's go five
 

787
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:14,810
might be too bright so let's go five
thousand

788
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:14,820
thousand
 

789
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,550
thousand
there we go that looks really nice and

790
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:16,560
there we go that looks really nice and
 

791
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,110
there we go that looks really nice and
it'll still be able to glow and we can

792
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:18,120
it'll still be able to glow and we can
 

793
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,090
it'll still be able to glow and we can
bring that radius higher which is

794
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:20,100
bring that radius higher which is
 

795
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,410
bring that radius higher which is
exactly what we should have been doing

796
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:21,420
exactly what we should have been doing
 

797
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,670
exactly what we should have been doing
originally

798
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:22,680
